# Implementation Space Exit Handoff

Compile Design Thinking Methods 7-9 outputs into a research-ready handoff artifact for `rpi-research`, with the exit tier retained as context.
Invoke when a team graduates from the Implementation Space and chooses lateral handoff to the RPI pipeline.
This is the final DT exit point: the richest handoff carrying cumulative artifact lineage from all nine methods.

## Inputs

* ${input:project-slug}: (Required) Kebab-case project identifier for the artifact directory (e.g., `factory-floor-maintenance`).

## Requirements

* All DT coaching artifacts are scoped to `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/`. Never write DT artifacts directly under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` without a project-slug directory.

## Required Steps

### Step 0: Load Handoff Knowledge

Before compiling any artifacts, activate `dt-rpi-integration`, then load these bundled references through its reference table:

* Handoff contract for the exit-point taxonomy, tier context, artifact schema, and quality markers.
* Subagent handoff for the readiness assessment and compilation workflow.
* Research context for `rpi-research` framing at the receiving end.

### Step 1: Read Coaching State

1. Use `${input:project-slug}` as the project directory identifier.
2. Read the coaching state file at `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/coaching-state.md`. If the file does not exist, report the missing file path and ask the user to verify the project name before proceeding.
3. Check `methods_completed` to determine the exit tier:
   * Method 7 only → tier 1 (guided).
   * Methods 7-8 → tier 2 (structured).
   * Methods 7-9 → tier 3 (comprehensive).
4. If no Implementation Space methods are complete, report status and suggest resuming coaching before handoff.
5. Record the determined tier for use in subsequent steps.

### Step 2: Compile DT Artifacts

Read all artifacts listed in the coaching state `artifacts` section and organize by method.
For each artifact, record the path, type, and evidence summary (a one to two sentence summary capturing the key finding or outcome documented in the artifact).
Note any expected artifact missing from the coaching state as a gap.

#### Method 7: Hi-Fi Prototypes

* Architecture decisions and technical trade-offs.
* Implementation comparison results (minimum 2-3 approaches).
* Fidelity mapping matrix.
* Performance benchmarks.
* Integration validation results.
* Specification drafts.

#### Method 8: User Testing (Tier 2+)

* Test protocols and participant profiles.
* Observation data (behavioral, verbal, task completion).
* Severity-frequency matrix findings.
* Assumption validation results (confirmed, challenged, invalidated).
* Iteration decision log (pivot vs persevere).

#### Method 9: Iteration at Scale (Tier 3)

* Refinement log with baseline measurements.
* Scaling assessment (technical, user, process, constraint dimensions).
* Deployment plan with change management.
* Iteration summary with business value metrics.
* Adoption metrics (leading and lagging indicators).

#### Handoff Lineage

Check for existing earlier handoff artifacts:

* `handoff-summary.md`: prior Problem Space handoff summary in the project directory.
* `handoff-summary-solution-space.md`: prior Solution Space handoff summary in the project directory, if a lateral exit occurred at Method 6.
* `rpi-handoff-problem-space.md`: Problem Space handoff artifact if a lateral exit occurred at Method 3.
* `rpi-handoff-solution-space.md`: Solution Space handoff artifact if a lateral exit occurred at Method 6.

If earlier handoff artifacts exist, reference them and summarize key outcomes.
If they do not exist (team ran through all methods without lateral exits), compile lineage from coaching state artifacts for Methods 1-6 directly:

* Validated problem statement, stakeholder map, synthesis themes, and constraint inventory from Problem Space (Methods 1-3).
* Tested concepts, lo-fi prototype feedback, constraint discoveries, and narrowed directions from Solution Space (Methods 4-6).

### Step 3: Readiness Assessment

Evaluate Implementation Space completion against tier-appropriate readiness signals:

* Working prototype with real data integration (M7).
* Operation validated under actual conditions (M7).
* Minimum 2-3 technical approaches compared (M7).
* Real users tested in real environments (M8, tier 2+).
* Behavioral observations captured alongside opinions (M8, tier 2+).
* Severity-frequency matrix applied to findings (M8, tier 2+).
* Telemetry captures meaningful patterns (M9, tier 3).
* Phased rollout plan with rollback capability (M9, tier 3).
* Business value metrics connect to outcomes (M9, tier 3).

Tag each readiness signal with a quality marker:

| Marker        | Definition                                               |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `validated`   | Confirmed through multiple sources or direct observation |
| `assumed`     | Stated by a source but not independently confirmed       |
| `unknown`     | Identified gap not yet investigated                      |
| `conflicting` | Multiple sources disagree                                |

Before continuing, verify explicit evidence that the user chose a lateral handoff. Accept either the current user request to run this handoff or a coaching state `session_log` entry that records the user's explicit handoff choice. Do not treat a `transition_log` entry, completed methods, available artifacts, or remembered conversation as approval. If prior approval cannot be established, present the readiness findings, include the question of whether to hand off in the response even when no answer is currently available, and stop before Step 4 without changing coaching state or creating handoff artifacts.

Readiness note: all Implementation Space exits hand off to `rpi-research` regardless of tier or prototype maturity. The exit tier and readiness assessment shape the investigation scope. Higher tiers with more validated evidence typically narrow the research needed without bypassing it.

If critical gaps exist (signals marked `unknown` or `conflicting`), present findings and ask whether to proceed with the handoff or return to address gaps first. If no response to this second question is available and prior handoff approval was verified, preserve the earlier choice, proceed with the handoff, and document every gap in the Investigation Priorities section. If prior approval was not verified, stop as described above. Never treat a missing response as initial handoff approval.

### Step 4: Produce Handoff Artifact

Create the handoff summary file at `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/handoff-summary-implementation-space.md` following the `implementation-spec-ready` exit-point schema in the `dt-rpi-integration` handoff contract.

Include the YAML header. The `tier` field extends the base DT-RPI handoff contract schema to capture exit granularity:

```yaml
exit_point: "implementation-spec-ready"
dt_method: 9          # or 7/8 based on tier
dt_space: "implementation"
handoff_target: "rpi-research"
date: "{today's date}"
tier: "comprehensive"  # guided | structured | comprehensive
```

Include these sections:

* Artifacts: each compiled artifact with path, type, and confidence marker.
* Constraints: each constraint with description, source, and confidence marker.
* Assumptions: each assumption with description, confidence, and impact rating (high/medium/low).

Record a lateral transition in the coaching state `transition_log`:

```yaml
- type: lateral
  from_method: 9      # or 7/8 based on tier
   to: "rpi-research"
   rationale: "Implementation Space complete: handoff to rpi-research with validated implementation artifacts"
  date: "{today's date}"
  tier: "comprehensive"   # guided | structured | comprehensive
```

### Step 5: Generate RPI Entry

Create a self-contained RPI handoff document at `.copilot-tracking/research/{project-slug}-research-topic.md` for `rpi-research` to consume as research-ready input.

Include YAML frontmatter with `description` set to a summary of the handoff context (for example, `description: 'RPI research topic from DT Implementation Space for {project name}'`).

Content sanitization: apply these rules before generating.

* Remove coaching notes, hint calibration data, and session management metadata.
* Convert DT method references to outcome descriptions. Replace "Method 7" with "high-fidelity prototype validation," "Method 8" with "user testing results," and "Method 9" with "iteration and scaling assessment."
* Preserve all evidence, metrics, and quotes verbatim.
* Remove temporal markers from handoff content.
* Retain confidence markers (validated, assumed, unknown, conflicting).

Structure the document with these sections:

#### Research Topic

Frame the implementation artifacts as a research question. State the validated prototype, architecture decisions, and what `rpi-research` should investigate further (production readiness, scaling gaps, integration concerns).

#### Validated Implementation Evidence

Architecture decisions, technical trade-offs, and prototype validation results from high-fidelity prototype validation. Testing observations and severity-frequency findings from user testing. Scaling assessment and deployment readiness from iteration at scale (tier 3 only).

#### Problem and Solution Space Lineage

Validated problem statement, stakeholder map, synthesis themes from Problem Space. Tested concepts, constraint discoveries, narrowed directions from Solution Space. Include from prior handoff artifacts or compiled from coaching state.

#### Known Constraints

Validated and assumed constraints with sources, organized by type.

#### Investigation Priorities

Items tagged `assumed`, `unknown`, or `conflicting` requiring investigation during `rpi-research`. Group by priority (blockers first, then high-impact, then lower-impact).

#### DT Artifact Paths

List all `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/` artifact paths so `rpi-research` can read original DT evidence directly.

Inline all content directly rather than referencing `.copilot-tracking/` paths (except in the DT Artifact Paths section).
The document stands alone as complete context for `rpi-research`.

### Step 6: Completion Ceremony

Present the completion ceremony as a conversational summary to the user covering these topics.

1. Journey summary: trace the path from initial request through Problem Space discovery, Solution Space validation, to Implementation Space technical proof. Compare the original request (`initial_request` from coaching state) to the validated solution.
2. Key pivot moments: highlight significant non-linear iterations and what they revealed.
3. Value delivered: summarize measurable business value from tier 3 (comprehensive) metrics or note expected value for earlier tiers.
4. Coaching state updates:
   * Confirm all completed methods in `methods_completed`.
   * Verify the lateral transition entry from Step 4 is recorded.
   * Append a completion summary to `session_log`.
5. Forward look: describe how the RPI pipeline carries the DT investment forward, naming `rpi-research` as the target phase and giving the handoff artifact path.
