# Review Artifacts Persistence Protocol

Any code review agent that produces a structured verdict follows this protocol to enable CI integration and cross-agent artifact compatibility.

## Folder Structure

```text
.copilot-tracking/
  reviews/
    code-reviews/
      <sanitized-branch>/
        review.md              # full markdown review output
        metadata.json          # machine-readable summary (see schema below)
        diff-state.json         # shared subagent input (branch, base, files, depth)
        dispatch-manifest.json  # canonical loop state (phase gates, next actions, board items)
        dispatch-board.md       # human-readable enumerated dispatch board
        walkthrough.md          # factual Register 1 orientation narrative
        emission-record.json    # selected emission mode, target, status, outcome
        explanations/
          <board-item>-<symbol>.md   # per-item Register 1 explanation artifacts
        walkback/
          <board-item>-research.md   # per-item Register 2 investigation artifacts
```

Sanitize the branch name by replacing every `/` with `-`
(e.g. `feat/my-feature` → `feat-my-feature`).

The `review.md`, `metadata.json`, `diff-state.json`, and `dispatch-manifest.json`
artifacts are always produced. The orientation-first artifacts
(`dispatch-board.md`, `walkthrough.md`, `explanations/`, `walkback/`, and
`emission-record.json`) are produced only when the review runs in interactive
orientation-first mode; omit them in non-interactive workflow runs.

## metadata.json Schema

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "branch": "<original branch name, e.g. feat/my-feature>",
  "head_commit": "<full SHA of HEAD at time of review>",
  "reviewed_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2026-02-27T10:00:00Z>",
  "verdict": "<normalized verdict - see table below>",
  "files_changed": ["<workspace-relative paths of source files in the diff>"],
  "findings_count": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0
  },
  "reviewer": "<agent or prompt name, e.g. code-review>",
  "artifacts": {
    "dispatch_manifest": "dispatch-manifest.json",
    "dispatch_board": "dispatch-board.md",
    "walkthrough": "walkthrough.md",
    "emission_record": "emission-record.json",
    "explanations": ["explanations/<board-item>-<symbol>.md"],
    "walkbacks": ["walkback/<board-item>-research.md"]
  }
}
```

The `artifacts` object records the orientation-first artifacts produced during
the review. Omit any key whose artifact was not produced (for example, omit
`artifacts` entirely for a non-interactive workflow run, or omit `explanations`
when no per-item explanation was requested). The `explanations` and `walkbacks`
values are arrays of review-folder-relative paths, one entry per board item
that was explained or investigated.

## Verdict Normalization

| Agent Output Verdict     | `verdict` value         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| ✅ Approve                | `approve`               |
| 💬 Approve with comments | `approve_with_comments` |
| ❌ Request changes        | `request_changes`       |

## Orientation-First Artifacts

Interactive orientation-first reviews persist the following artifacts alongside
`review.md` and `metadata.json`. Each is referenced from `review.md` so the
markdown report links to the supporting evidence.

* `dispatch-manifest.json` — the canonical loop state: `phaseGates`,
  `currentPhase`, `nextActions`, and `boardItems`. This is the machine-readable
  source of truth for the human-steered walk-back loop.
* `dispatch-board.md` — the human-readable enumerated board rendered from the
  manifest `boardItems`: id, area, status, register, summary, openable links,
  and selectable symbols.
* `walkthrough.md` — the factual Register 1 orientation narrative (diff summary,
  runway summary, and appendices) presented before any findings register. It
  contains no severity grades or verdicts.
* `explanations/<board-item>-<symbol>.md` — per-item Register 1 explanation
  artifacts written by the explainer when a human asks a shallow factual
  question about a symbol. Each includes the answer, source file reference,
  relevant code excerpt, and follow-on symbols.
* `walkback/<board-item>-research.md` — per-item Register 2 investigation
  artifacts written by the walk-back researcher when a human asks a deep
  investigative question. Each is anchored to its board item.
* `emission-record.json` — the selected emission `mode` (native or canonical),
  `target` (PR, MR, ADO, or review artifact), `status` (completed or skipped),
  and a short outcome `summary`.

## Change-Risk Decision State

`diff-state.json` is the canonical owner of the evidence and depth decision used by every review lane:

* `reviewStateProvenance` records `human-confirmed` or `automation-derived` origins for `scope`, `changeRiskEvidence`, `recommendedDepth`, `depthTier`, and `depthRationale`. It describes origin, not confidence.
* `changeRiskEvidence` contains exactly one entry for each of `change-scope`, `path-criticality`, `history`, `test-presence`, `coverage`, and `rollback`.
* Each entry contains `signal`, `availability`, and `evidence`. The `availability` field records the evidence state, not confidence in a claim. Its value is `observed`, `unavailable`, or `qualitative`; unavailable inputs remain explicit and are never fabricated.
* `recommendedDepth` records the advisory `basic`, `standard`, or `comprehensive` recommendation. Use `standard` when evidence is incomplete or inconclusive unless observed evidence supports comprehensive review.
* In interactive mode, existing `depthTier` remains the human-selected verification depth, and `depthRationale` explains that selection and any difference from `recommendedDepth`. Mark scope, evidence, depth, and rationale as `human-confirmed`; keep the advisory recommendation `automation-derived`.
* In workflow mode, mark all five provenance values `automation-derived`. Host-supplied or default values are not represented as human-confirmed.

In interactive mode, write these values after human scope and depth confirmation. In workflow mode, write them after automated context preparation. Complete either write before perspective dispatch. Subagents consume the values and provenance as shared context but do not recalculate or overwrite them.

## Writing Rules

* Always overwrite any existing `review.md` and `metadata.json` for the branch: only the latest review per branch is retained.
* Obtain the HEAD commit SHA with `git rev-parse HEAD` immediately before writing artifacts.
* Obtain the current UTC timestamp immediately before writing artifacts:
  * In POSIX-compatible shells, use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`.
  * In PowerShell, use `Get-Date -AsUtc -Format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ"`.
* `files_changed` must list only source files present in the diff (additions, modifications, or deletions). Filter by relevance - e.g. `.py`, `.sh`, `.ts`, `.tf` - excluding lock files, binaries, and build output.
* Do not write artifacts if the diff was empty and the review was aborted.
* The `reviewer` field must use the kebab-case form of the agent's or prompt's `name` from its frontmatter (e.g. `hve-core:code-review-agent` → `code-review`).
* Write orientation-first artifacts only when the review runs in interactive orientation-first mode; record each produced artifact under the `artifacts` key in `metadata.json` and link it from `review.md`.
* Keep `walkthrough.md` and `explanations/` artifacts factual (Register 1): no severity grades or verdicts. Keep `walkback/` artifacts in the structured investigation register (Register 2).
* Create the `explanations/` and `walkback/` subfolders only when at least one explanation or investigation artifact is written.
* Every `review.md` ends with a **Disclaimer and Human Review** section: the verbatim `## Code-Review` CAUTION disclaimer from `hve-core:disclaimer-language` skill followed by an unchecked `- [ ] Reviewed and validated by a qualified human reviewer` checkbox. This section is always present, is always the final section, and the agent never checks the checkbox; only a human may convert `[ ]` to `[x]`.
* When the review scope targets a pull request or merge request, `review.md` includes a mandatory human-editable **PR Comment Draft** section with an unchecked posting checkbox. This section is the only place the general PR or MR comment is authored; the agent never reproduces the full drafted comment body in the conversational summary. The agent never checks the posting box; only the human may convert `[ ]` to `[x]`, and that check is the gate that authorizes posting the general PR or MR comment.
