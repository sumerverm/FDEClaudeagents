# DT Canonical Deck

Single prompt that handles both canonical deck and customer-card build flows.

## Inputs

- `${input:project-slug}`: Optional DT project slug under `.copilot-tracking/dt/`.
- `{{action}}`: One of `offer`, `build`, or `run`.
  - `offer`: offer canonical snapshot creation or refresh.
  - `build`: build customer-card PPTX from canonical artifacts.
  - `run`: execute offer flow, and if accepted, execute optional build flow.
- `${input:method-context}`: Optional method number.
- `${input:trigger-context:explicit-request}`: Optional offer context (`explicit-request`, `method-exit`).

## Workflow Rules

1. Canonical workflow is available on request at any time, and offered automatically only at eligible asset-ready method exits.
2. Decline is valid and non-blocking. Do not gate method transitions.
3. Apply canonical workflow rules by loading the `dt-coaching-foundation` skill and its `references/canonical-deck.md`.

## Step 1: Resolve Project Slug

If no project slug was provided in inputs:

1. List all projects in `.copilot-tracking/dt/` by reading the `coaching-state.md` files
2. Ask the user to select which project: *"Which DT project? (Found: [list projects]. Choose one or enter a new slug.)"
3. Record the chosen slug and resolve paths using the selected project

Once slug is resolved, establish these paths:

1. Project root: `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}`
2. Canonical dir: `{project-root}/canonical`
3. Render dir: `{project-root}/render`
4. Customer-card skill root: the loaded `customer-card-render` skill root
5. PowerPoint skill root: the loaded `powerpoint` skill root

## Step 2: Offer Branch (`action=offer` or `action=run`)

Run the asset-readiness check from `canonical-deck.md` first. When no DT method outputs map to a supported canonical artifact type, make no offer, say what is missing, and stop.

When assets are ready, offer snapshot creation or refresh at the Method 3 and Method 5 exits defined in `canonical-deck.md`:

> We can snapshot the canonical deck now so your current artifacts stay traceable. Generate or refresh now?

If declined, record the decline and stop.

If accepted:

1. Detect create vs refresh mode from canonical directory state.
2. Generate or refresh canonical entries from DT artifacts.
3. Update snapshot metadata in coaching state.

## Step 2.5: Verify Skill Interfaces (Before Build)

Before executing build commands, verify the actual command parameters by reading the skill documentation:

1. Load `customer-card-render` and check its skill instructions under `generate_cards.py CLI Reference` for the exact flags and parameters for `generate_cards.py`
2. Load `powerpoint` and check its skill instructions for the exact parameters for `Invoke-PptxPipeline.ps1` (PowerShell) or `invoke-pptx-pipeline.sh` (bash)
3. Confirm parameter names match the commands shown in Step 3 below. If skill interfaces have changed, update commands accordingly and inform the user of any parameter differences

## Step 3: Build Branch (`action=build` or accepted `action=run`)

Ask before PPTX build unless the user explicitly requested build in this turn:

> Want me to build the customer-card PowerPoint from the canonical deck now?

If accepted:

1. **Determine the active shell runtime** by observing the current terminal type (PowerShell vs bash/Git Bash/WSL)
2. **Execute the appropriate build path** based on the active runtime:

**If PowerShell terminal is active:**

Run the two-command flow using the confirmed parameters from Step 2.5:

1. Generate slide YAML:

```bash
python "<customer-card-render-skill-root>/scripts/generate_cards.py" \
  --canonical-dir .copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/canonical \
  --output-dir .copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/render/content
```

2. Build PPTX using existing PowerPoint pipeline:

```powershell
& "<powerpoint-skill-root>/scripts/Invoke-PptxPipeline.ps1" -Action Build \
  -ContentDir .copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/render/content \
  -StylePath .copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/render/content/global/style.yaml \
  -OutputPath .copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/render/output/customer-cards.pptx
```

**If bash terminal is active (Git Bash, WSL, or similar):**

Use the bash script instead. Verify the bash script flags by sending `invoke-pptx-pipeline.sh --help` first, then run the build command with the confirmed flags.

**Execution Rules:**

- Use `send_to_terminal` to send commands to the active terminal
- Use `get_terminal_output` to poll for completion
- Do not run `pip install` or manual dependency installation
- Rely on PowerPoint skill environment setup (`uv sync`) and documented prerequisites
- Keep output under the project slug render directory

## Step 4: Response Template

Success:

> Canonical workflow updated successfully.
> Canonical: `<project canonical path>`
> PPTX: `<project render/output/customer-cards.pptx>`

Offer declined:

> Skipped for now. You can ask for the canonical deck any time, and I'll offer again when there's more to capture.

Build failure:

> YAML generation completed, but PPTX build failed due to `<friendly cause>`.
> Next:
> 1. Verify PowerShell and Python prerequisites.
> 2. Re-run the PowerPoint build command from the same render content.
