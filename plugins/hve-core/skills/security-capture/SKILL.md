# Security Capture

## Startup

Before startup behavior, require the Security Planner to locate the available instruction file named `hve-core:disclaimer-language` skill, read `hve-core:disclaimer-language` skill in full, and use its `Security Planning` section as the canonical disclaimer text. If the instruction cannot be found or loaded, halt before questions, analysis, state initialization, or phase work instead of improvising or omitting the disclaimer.

Check the project `state.json`. If it does not exist or `disclaimerShownAt` is `null`, display the canonical Security Planning CAUTION block verbatim, set `disclaimerShownAt` to the current ISO 8601 timestamp, append the matching `noticeLog` entry, and persist state before continuing. If the field is non-null, suppress automatic redisplay during normal continuation. If the user requests redisplay, show the full disclaimer, update `disclaimerShownAt`, and append a notice with `details.reason: "user-requested-redisplay"`.

After the disclaimer, display the framework attribution `OWASP ASVS • OWASP Top 10 • NIST SSDF`. Display both the disclaimer and the attribution before any questions or analysis.

## Inputs

* ${input:project-slug}: (Optional) Kebab-case project identifier for the artifact directory. When omitted, asks for a suitable project name and derives the slug.

## Requirements

* Initialize capture mode by creating the project directory at `.copilot-tracking/security-plans/{project-slug}/` and writing `state.json` with `entryMode: "capture"`, `currentPhase: 1`, and empty or default values for remaining fields.
* If the user provides existing security notes, threat assessments, or documentation as input, extract relevant information and pre-populate Phase 1 fields before asking clarifying questions.
* Begin the Phase 1 interview about the project's security posture with 3-5 focused questions covering: project name and purpose, technology stack, deployment target (cloud, on-prem, hybrid), types of data processed or stored, and known compliance requirements.

## Entry Behavior

Start security planning in capture mode. Initialize the project directory and begin the Phase 1 scoping interview.
