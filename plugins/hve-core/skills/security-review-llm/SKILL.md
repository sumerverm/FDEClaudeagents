> **Role.** Before doing anything else, load the `hve-core:security-reviewer` skill with the `Skill` tool and operate under it for the rest of this task.

> **Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`

> Parse the arguments above (typically `key=value` form, see the argument hint) into: `{{scope}}`. A missing optional value means its documented default.


# LLM and Agentic Vulnerability Scan

> [!CAUTION]
> This prompt is an **assistive tool only** and does not replace professional security tooling (SAST, DAST, SCA, penetration testing, compliance scanners) or qualified human review. All AI-generated vulnerability findings **must** be reviewed and validated by qualified security professionals before use. AI outputs may contain inaccuracies, miss critical threats, or produce recommendations that are incomplete or inappropriate for your environment.

## Inputs

* {{scope}}: (Optional) Specific component or directory path to focus the assessment on.

## Requirements

* Override skill selection with `owasp-llm, owasp-agentic`. The profiler still runs to supply codebase context, but skill detection is bypassed in favor of these two skills.
* When `{{scope}}` is provided, limit analysis to files within the specified directory or component.
* Run in `audit` mode using the standard assessment and verification workflow.
* Assess both skills independently through separate Skill Assessor invocations, then consolidate findings in a single report.
