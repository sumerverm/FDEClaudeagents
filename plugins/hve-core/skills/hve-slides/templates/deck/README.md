title: HTML slide deck starter
description: Create, edit, build and share a local presentation-first HTML deck.
---

## Build and view

Use Node.js 24 or later. In this deck's directory:

```bash
npm ci
npm run bundle
npm test
```

Restore dependencies only when needed. `bundle` builds the folder first, then writes
`docs/slides/<directory-name>.html` at the repository root. For a deck under `slides/my-deck/`,
the bundle is `docs/slides/my-deck.html`. Open that file directly in a desktop browser. Alternatively,
`npm run build` writes `dist/index.html` with local sibling files. Open generated output,
not the source HTML. No server, live agent or authentication is needed.

Commit the regenerated bundle with its source updates. The intermediate `dist/` assets
and `node_modules/` remain ignored. Edit source files rather than the generated HTML.
The documentation site lists committed bundles on its Slides page after the next
site build. Its links open the HTML directly, preserving the presentation controls.
The page displays the `title` and `description` from `deck.json`. Bundling embeds
these fields as inert JSON in the HTML; adding or renaming a catalog entry requires
only source metadata edits and a rebuild, not hand-editing the HTML or site.
From the repository root, `npm run slides:check` verifies that every committed bundle
matches source without rewriting it. The template exports `checkBundle()` for this check.
Pull request validation runs this deck's tests when any of its files change. When
Dependabot updates reveal.js here, rebuild and commit the bundle on that branch.

The default four slides are neutral layout examples, not researched HVE product claims.
Change them before presenting. The walkthrough is scripted and all chat controls inside
it are display-only; only the presenter controls perform local actions.

## Source owners

| File                              | Edit here                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `deck.json`                       | Presentation title, description and source qualification                   |
| `index.html`                      | Slide order, stable IDs, headings, notes, citation keys and example mounts |
| `content.js`                      | Sources, examples, walkthrough steps and state/diff helpers                |
| `components.js`, `components.css` | Code, request, question/answer and implementation views                    |
| `theme.css`                       | Presentation colors, typography, layouts and controls                      |
| `deck.js`                         | Slide/step navigation, dialogs, focus and keyboard behavior                |
| `build.mjs`                       | Local asset list and generation of `dist/config.js` from `deck.json`       |
| `bundle.mjs`                      | Self-contained HTML packaging and resource checks                          |
| `deck.test.cjs`                   | Source, state, configuration and bundling tests                            |

Keep source and generated files separate. Changes to `deck.json` require a rebuild;
the browser reads its generated classic script, not a runtime JSON fetch.
For new slides, provide unique `id`, `data-title`, `data-chapter` and appropriate
`data-sources` values. Keep private evidence out of the source registry and notes.

For a static example, add a `data-example` mount whose key exists in `examples`.
For a walkthrough, add one `data-demo` host and its entry in `demos`. Each step's
phase must appear in that demo's `phases` array. Unknown data fails visibly.
Use a different demo key for another independent walkthrough.

Keep `vendor/reveal.js`, `config.js`, `content.js`, `components.js` and `deck.js`
in that order. The bundler recognizes the declared stylesheet and deferred classic-script
tag shapes. Do not change their attributes or introduce new resource types without
updating the parser and tests. Keep styles in declared CSS files: source inline style
blocks and `style` attributes are rejected by the bundler.

## Presenter controls

| Control                           | Behavior                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Left / Right, Page Up / Page Down | Previous / next slide, including from a focused button   |
| Space / Shift+Space               | Next / previous slide                                    |
| Home / End                        | First / last slide                                       |
| Back / Next step, \[ / \]         | Previous / next walkthrough step                         |
| Reset or R                        | Reset only the current walkthrough                       |
| O / S / N / ?                     | Slide index / sources / notes / keyboard help            |
| F                                 | Browser full screen when available                       |
| Escape                            | Close an overlay and return focus                        |
| Tab / Enter                       | Reach and activate controls                              |
| Motion                            | Optional fades; reduced-motion preference takes priority |

Left / Right and Page Up / Page Down keep paging after a presenter button or link is
clicked, because those controls do not use the keys. Editable fields, open dialogs and
modifier shortcuts keep their normal behavior, and so does selected text unless a button
or link has focus. A component that needs the keys, such as a roving-focus diagram or
focusable scroll region, handles them on its own element and calls `preventDefault()` or
`stopPropagation()`. Other shortcuts wait while a control has focus, so Space and Enter
activate it. Walkthroughs retain their step when revisiting slides. Reload restores the
slide hash but resets walkthroughs. Nothing advances automatically. The unused reveal.js
cross-window `postMessage` API is disabled.

The design canvas is 1600 by 900 and should also be checked at 1280 by 720.
Reading view switches to unscaled, scrollable content. It starts automatically on compact
viewports and can be toggled at any size. Character shortcuts, including Space, work only
while the presentation surface itself has focus; Tab reaches that surface and its controls.
New layouts must preserve reading-view reflow as well as the projected layout.

The bottom bar shows the HVE Core mark and current chapter, the presenter buttons, then
slide navigation. `--presenter-height` sizes both the bar and the slide area above it. The
bar keeps its ends `--presenter-inset` from the window edges, so viewer overlays such as the
Copilot button SharePoint places at the bottom right do not cover the chapter label or slide
navigation. With reading view off, the bar compacts at 1366 pixels wide and stacks
centered rows at 1240 pixels or narrower. Keep chapter labels short: the bottom-chrome
test allows 28 characters, which keeps the bar on one row at desktop widths.

Opening and closing slides use `.slide-bottom` for repository and fidelity labels above a
divider. Each walkthrough keeps Back, Next step and Reset in the footer of its example
frame, so the controls stay in place between steps. Fit every step inside that frame
without internal scrolling. The bottom-chrome test in `deck.test.cjs` records this
contract; change it only with a deliberate redesign.

## Verify and share

After editing, run the scoped tests and inspect the actual browser result, including
all changed slides and walkthrough states, keyboard/focus, dialogs and reduced motion.
Check 320px reflow, 200% browser zoom, increased text spacing, contrast and accessible
names/roles. Keep inactive slides out of the reading and focus order and preserve the
single announcement channel. Test keyboard interactions separately from static scans.
Node tests do not establish rendered quality or interaction correctness.

Copy only the single HTML file to an empty temporary directory, rename it and open it
with network disabled. It must work without the source folder. Retain the full reveal.js
notice embedded by the bundler and this starter's MIT license in source distributions.

OneDrive can share the file for download; its preview is not website hosting. A hosted
interactive URL requires a separate approved publishing step. Recipients can read every
note, example and embedded source string. Do not include credentials or private data.

## Template maintenance

This deck was created from the repository-only HVE Slides starter. Its files are local
copies, not runtime imports from another deck. Adapt them deliberately; do not overwrite
an existing deck with a newer template.

The repository template is the maintained source for future scaffolds. The full HVE
Updates example may use a thin build-time wrapper around that canonical bundler; a newly
scaffolded deck includes its own complete copy and does not need that wrapper.
