# Starter and Fragment Guide

## Create a New Deck

The [deck starter](../templates/deck/README.md) is a runnable, neutral reveal.js presentation
with four example slides and a four-step scripted walkthrough. It includes local
navigation, source/notes dialogs, keyboard and focus handling, unscaled reading view,
reduced motion, build/bundle
scripts, a pinned lockfile and Node tests. It also carries the shared
[bottom chrome](design-and-examples.md#bottom-chrome): a presenter bar with the HVE Core
mark and chapter, a divided slide footer and a framed walkthrough with its step controls
in the frame footer.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run slides:create -- --slug contributor-tour --title "Contributor tour"
```

The [scaffold script](../scripts/create-deck.mjs) copies a fixed list of template files into
`slides/contributor-tour/`. It sets the package/lockfile name and the title in `deck.json`.
It rejects invalid slugs, existing files/directories and symbolic-link destinations.
It also rejects a symbolic-link `slides/` parent. It never overwrites an existing deck,
executes package commands, installs a browser, starts a server or publishes anything.
The npm alias calls `node .github/skills/hve-slides/scripts/create-deck.mjs`; direct
Node invocation supports the same flags and does not depend on the caller's directory.

Template reads validate and consume the same open file handle. A replacement detected
between opening and validation fails; a later path replacement cannot redirect the read.

If a filesystem error interrupts copying after the new directory is created, the script
reports the partial destination and leaves it for inspection rather than deleting files
that someone else might have added. Correct the cause and inspect that directory before
deciding how to continue; rerunning does not overwrite it.

After creation, restore dependencies when permitted and needed, then build:

```bash
npm ci --prefix slides/contributor-tour
npm run bundle --prefix slides/contributor-tour
npm test --prefix slides/contributor-tour
```

Open `docs/slides/contributor-tour.html`. The filename follows the
directory name. Generated source includes its own build/bundle modules and needs no
runtime imports from the skill or the HVE Updates deck.

The scaffold's `--title` value becomes the catalog label. Set a concise description
in `deck.json`, then bundle. Docusaurus reads the embedded title and description,
lists every deck automatically, and keeps URLs tied to slugs rather than labels.

Scaffolding is not completion of the presentation. Replace the title/description/source
note in `deck.json`, the story and notes in `index.html`, and the examples/citations in
`content.js`. Add researched claims and appropriate sources before presenting. The starter
does not inherit HVE history, a snack theme, plugin instructions or an RPI Agent requirement.

## Build All Decks

After restoring each deck's dependencies, run from the repository root:

```bash
npm run slides:build
```

The [build-all script](../scripts/build-decks.mjs) discovers every immediate
directory under `slides/`, sorted by name, and calls each deck's exported
`bundleDeck()` function. Existing and newly scaffolded decks each retain their own
`docs/slides/<deck-slug>.html`; there is no combined presentation. Both the folder build
and single-file bundle are refreshed by the existing bundler.

Each directory must contain a regular `bundle.mjs` that exports `bundleDeck()`
and returns the absolute path of its nonempty `docs/slides/<deck-slug>.html`. Plain files
under `slides/`, including existing bundles, are ignored during deck discovery.
Symbolic links and missing or incompatible bundlers
fail explicitly. The command stops on the first failure, leaving any earlier
successful outputs in place. It never installs dependencies, starts a server or
publishes. The template under this skill is not included in discovery.

Commit the regenerated single-file HTML with the deck source updates. Keep each
deck's intermediate `dist/` directory and `node_modules/` ignored.
Run `npm run slides:check` to verify the committed bundles without rewriting them.
This calls each module's exported `checkBundle()` function, rebuilds ignored intermediate
assets, and rejects missing, stale, or orphaned HTML. Older copied bundlers need the
current `checkBundle()` export before they can participate in this verification.
The Docusaurus site discovers the committed HTML files for its Slides page. Run
`npm run docs:build` after bundling to refresh the site; no deck dependencies are
needed for a site-only build. After adding or removing a bundle during local site
development, restart the site so the static files and catalog are refreshed.

## Adapt an Existing Deck

Do not run `create-deck.mjs` over an existing deck or copy the entire starter onto it.
Read the incumbent architecture and adapt only the required fragment, data and styles.

| Fragment                                                                    | Use                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| [split-evidence.html](../templates/fragments/split-evidence.html)           | Explanation beside a code or evidence surface                 |
| [workflow.html](../templates/fragments/workflow.html)                       | Four connected ordered steps                                  |
| [copilot-request.html](../templates/fragments/copilot-request.html)         | Passive reconstructed request composer                        |
| [question-answer.html](../templates/fragments/question-answer.html)         | Scripted question and recorded answer side by side            |
| [implementation-diff.html](../templates/fragments/implementation-diff.html) | Checked tasks, changes excerpt and derived diff counts        |
| [walkthrough.html](../templates/fragments/walkthrough.html)                 | Presenter-stepped example with phase/state beside its content |

These are source fragments to copy and adapt, not independent HTML pages or runtime
includes. Insert a selected section inside `.slides`. Give it a unique ID, title and
chapter, replace its citation keys, and author notes for its actual content.

The fragments use the starter's `data-example` and `data-demo` conventions:

* Static keys resolve in `DeckContent.examples`, rendered by `DeckComponents.renderExample`.
* Demo keys resolve in `DeckContent.demos`; each host needs a unique key, and every step's
  phase must be in its demo's phase list.
* `walkthrough.html` reuses the default `example` key. Replace the existing host, or add a
  new data entry/key before inserting it as another walkthrough.
* Component data, not the fragment, owns requests, options, answers, tasks and diff rows.
* The starter styles live in `theme.css` and `components.css`. Copy the required rules
  only when the destination has no suitable owner.
* Preserve heading order, passive reconstruction semantics, text alternatives and the
  reading-view rules when adapting fragments. Validate the resulting slide at 320px and
  with enlarged or spaced text, not only on the presentation canvas.

HVE Updates uses different globals and initialization. Adapt a fragment to that existing
data/renderer contract; pasting a starter mount alone will not initialize it there.
Preserve its RPI guidance, current examples and unrelated edits.

## Template Maintenance and Checks

The canonical bundler lives in `templates/deck/bundle.mjs`. New decks copy it. HVE Updates
has a thin wrapper passing its own build function, so there is no second maintained parser.
Keep imported modules free of build side effects. Do not introduce cross-deck browser
imports, automatic template upgrades or an overwrite option to the scaffold script.

Keep the starter's bottom chrome in step with the finished HVE decks. When that shared
treatment changes, update the starter in the same change. Its `deck.test.cjs` checks the
contract and is copied into every new deck, so a later layout edit that drops the deck
mark, desynchronizes the bar height or moves walkthrough controls out of their frame fails
that deck's tests.

The skill's `scripts/` and `tests/` are maintenance tooling, not copied into a new deck.
Run the bounded checks after changing the starter, scaffold script or build-all script:

```bash
npm run test:slides
npm test --prefix .github/skills/hve-slides/templates/deck
npm test --prefix slides/hve-updates
```

The template package requires its own current dependency installation for its bundle test
and the multi-deck integration test in `test:slides`.
Use the existing deck test when changing the shared bundler. Add safety regressions to the
scaffold-script tests and keep runtime/content tests in the copied `deck.test.cjs`.
Refresh actual browser evidence for changed runtime behavior, as described in
[validation.md](validation.md). A scaffold test does not prove the resulting presentation
looks good or handles focus correctly.
