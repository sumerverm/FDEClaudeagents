# Agents Conformance Checks

## Overview

This reference enumerates the nine conformance checks the `vally-tests` skill knows how to express for `.agent.md` artifacts, covering both top-level agents and subagents. The conformance taxonomy research carries an eleven-entry list; this reference consolidates the research's separate "Subagent H1 Heading Matches Name" and "Required Subagent Sections" entries into a single structural-template check and omits the retired source-attribution check, matching the count published in `SKILL.md`.

The canonical eval target for this kind, per `eval-suite-routing.md`, is `evals/agent-behavior/stimuli/<slug>.yml` where `<slug>` is the agent filename minus the `.agent.md` suffix (for example `hve-core:rpi-agent` routes to `evals/agent-behavior/stimuli/rpi-agent.yml`). New stimulus blocks are appended to that file's `stimuli:` array (creating the file from the standard preamble if it does not exist) and tagged `tags.advisory: true`. Authors MUST run every candidate stimulus through `refusal-taxonomy.md` before emission and refuse any match.

Grader recommendations below name the literal Vally `type:` keywords, `output-matches` and `prompt`. [grader-catalog.md](./grader-catalog.md) maps the conceptual aliases used elsewhere in this skill (`regex`, `semantic_similarity`) to those keywords.

## Stimulus Staging and Grading

Every check asks an agent to report what a specific `.agent.md` artifact declares. The agent-behavior suite does not stage `.github/agents/` globally, so a stimulus that names an unstaged artifact cannot be answered and fails on every trial. Apply these rules to every check below:

* Stage the artifact under test at the path the stimulus names, with a source path relative to the compiled suite file (`evals/agent-behavior/eval.yaml` for agents):

  ```yaml
  agent_environment:
    files:
      - src: ../../.github/agents/<package>/<name>.agent.md
        dest: .github/agents/<package>/<name>.agent.md
  ```

  Stage any other file the question depends on, such as an instruction file or skill the target says it requires, so the agent does not halt on a missing dependency.
* End the stimulus with: "If the file cannot be read, report the task as blocked without inventing its declarations." A blocked reply is then distinguishable from an invented one.
* Grade the reply, not the file. Output graders read the agent's answer, so assert the reported value (a name, a flag value, heading words) rather than frontmatter syntax such as `^description:`. Validate file-only properties, such as the description length limit, with frontmatter linting instead of a reply grader.
* Accept the formats a correct answer uses: backticked values, sentences, and bulleted, numbered, or inline lists. Constrain order only when order is the behavior under test.
* Guard every negated grader against truthful denial, and keep positive and negated checks in separate graders.
* Before appending, probe each pattern offline against answers that must pass and answers that must fail.

[grader-robustness.md](./grader-robustness.md) owns the detailed mounting, order, proximity, and negation rules and the offline probe. The patterns below are starting shapes; substitute the target's actual values and re-probe them.

## Conformance Checks

### Check 1: Required Frontmatter Fields

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: agent frontmatter MUST include a non-empty `description:` field under 120 characters AND a `name:` field carrying the human-readable agent name (for example `hve-core:rpi-agent`).
* Suggested stimulus: stage the artifact and ask the agent to report the human-readable name declared in its frontmatter and to restate its declared description verbatim.
* Grader recommendation: `output-matches` asserting the reported name, for example `(?i)\bRPI Agent\b`, plus a second `output-matches` asserting a distinctive clause of the declared description. Add a separate negated `output-matches` rejecting the filename slug reported as the name, guarded so a file-name mention does not fire, for example `(?i)(?<!file\s?)\bname\s*(?:is|:)\s*.{0,3}rpi-agent\b(?!\.agent\.md)`.
* Evidence: `.github/agents/hve-core/`hve-core:rpi-agent` and `.github/agents/hve-core/`hve-core:documentation` follow this pair.

### Check 2: Conversational vs Autonomous Protocol Distinction

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Outcome and Structure.
* Testable behavior: conversational agents MUST present their workflow as `## Required Phases` (multi-turn, user-guided); autonomous agents MUST present their workflow as `## Required Steps` (task execution, minimal user interaction). The protocol type chosen MUST match the agent's purpose as stated in its description.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the artifact and ask whether it runs conversationally or autonomously and which section heading carries its protocol.
* Grader recommendation: `prompt` with rubric "Does the agent's protocol type (Phases vs Steps) match the conversational vs autonomous purpose stated in its description?".
* Evidence: `.github/agents/project-planning/`hve-core:backlog-manager` uses Required Phases consistent with its conversational purpose.

### Check 3: Subagent Dependencies Declared in Frontmatter

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Delegate Deliberately and Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: omit `agents:` when a parent may invoke any available subagent. Use an explicit array when the parent has a fixed allowlist, including `agents: []` when it may invoke none. Fixed entries MUST use each subagent's human-readable `name:` rather than a filename or path. A wildcard string is non-conforming.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the parent artifact and ask whether it has unrestricted, fixed, or empty subagent access and, for a fixed set, which human-readable names it declares.
* Grader recommendation: `prompt` with rubric "Does the response distinguish omitted `agents:` as unrestricted access from explicit fixed arrays, accept `[]` as an empty fixed set, reject wildcard strings, and use human-readable names for fixed entries?" A single mandatory-list pattern cannot represent all valid modes.
* Evidence: `.github/agents/hve-core/`hve-core:documentation` omits `agents:`; `.github/agents/experimental/`hve-core:pptx` declares a fixed `hve-core:pptx-subagent` array; `.github/agents/security/subagents/`hve-core:cve-analyzer` declares `agents: []`.

### Check 4: Subagent user-invocable Flag

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: files under `.github/agents/**/subagents/` SHOULD set `user-invocable: false` in frontmatter to keep subagents out of the user-facing agent picker. Top-level agents omit the flag or set it to `true`.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the artifact and ask for the value its frontmatter declares for `user-invocable` and how a user reaches it given that value.
* Grader recommendation: for a subagent, `output-matches` associating the field with an affirmative value in the same sentence in either order, for example ``(?im)(?<![\s\S])(?![\s\S]*(?:\b(?:not|never|no|omits?|omitted|lacks?)\b|\b\w+n[\x27\u2019]t\b)[\s`*_~]+(?:(?!(?:true|because|since|as|so|given|hence|thus)\b)\w+[\s`*_~]+){0,2}(?:user-invocable[\s`*_~]*:[\s`*_~]*)?\bfalse\b)[\s\S]*?(?:^|[.!?](?=\s|$))(?=(?:[^.!?\n]|[.!?](?=\S))*(?:\buser-invocable\b(?:[^.!?\n]|[.!?](?=\S)){0,40}\bfalse\b|\bfalse\b(?:[^.!?\n]|[.!?](?=\S)){0,60}\buser-invocable\b))(?!(?:[^.!?\n]|[.!?](?=\S))*\bfalse\b[\s`*_~]*(?:is|are)\s+(?:absent|not\s+(?:set|declared|present))\b)(?:[^.!?\n]|[.!?](?=\S))*``. Sentences end only at `.`, `!`, or `?` followed by whitespace, so file names such as `.agent.md` stay inside their sentence. This accepts `user-invocable: false, not true`, "the `user-invocable` value is set to `false`", "`false` is the declared value for `user-invocable`", "the flag is not true and `user-invocable: false`", and "it is not selectable because `user-invocable: false`", while rejecting negated or absent values anywhere in the reply, such as "the value is not `false`", "the frontmatter does not declare `user-invocable: false`", "the frontmatter omits `user-invocable: false`", and "`user-invocable: false` is absent". Add an `output-matches` asserting that the reply names the dispatching parent or orchestrator, and a separate guarded negated `output-matches` rejecting a claim that the subagent is selectable from the agent picker. For a top-level agent, assert that the reply reports the flag as omitted or `true`.
* Evidence: any subagent under `.github/agents/**/subagents/` carrying `user-invocable: false`; top-level agents such as `.github/agents/hve-core/`hve-core:rpi-agent` do not declare the flag.

### Check 5: Subagent Structural Template

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Delegate Deliberately and Outcome and Structure (the canonical subagent section pattern: H1 matching the name, Purpose, Inputs, a named output artifact, Required Steps, an optional Required Protocol, and a Response Format).
* Testable behavior: subagent files MUST present the following structure:
  * An H1 heading whose text matches the frontmatter `name:` field exactly.
  * A Purpose section that states the subagent's objectives.
  * An Inputs section that distinguishes required from optional inputs.
  * An Output artifact section that names the file or tracking artifact the subagent updates progressively.
  * A Required Steps section that opens with a Pre-requisite step and continues with numbered steps.
  * OPTIONAL Required Protocol section for meta-rules and execution constraints.
  * A Response Format section that defines the structured return to the parent.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the artifact and ask for every level-one and level-two section heading in order, exactly as written, and whether its first heading matches the frontmatter name. "Top-level headings" alone is ambiguous: hosted replies sometimes list only the H1.
* Grader recommendation: one `output-matches` per required section asserting the heading words in the reply, case-sensitive for single words so ordinary prose does not satisfy them: `\bPurpose\b`, `\bInputs\b`, `(?i)Required\s+Steps`, `(?i)Response\s+Format`. These accept numbered, bulleted, and inline lists. Add an `output-matches` asserting that the reply confirms the H1 matches the name.
* Evidence: the delegated-task contract in `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Delegate Deliberately; `.github/agents/coding-standards/subagents/`hve-core:code-review-functional` follows the subagent structure.

### Check 6: Handoff Pattern Structure

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: when an agent declares `handoffs:`, each entry MUST include `label:` (display text, MAY contain emoji) and `agent:` (human-readable agent name from the target agent's `name:` field). Each entry MAY also carry a slash command and an auto-send flag, listed under Evidence.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the artifact and ask which other agents it can hand off to and what label each handoff carries, identifying each target the way the artifact does.
* Grader recommendation: `output-matches` asserting that each declared target and its label appear on the same line in either order, one grader per handoff entry, for example `(?im)^.*\bBacklog Manager\b.*\bExecute Hierarchy\b|^.*\bExecute Hierarchy\b.*\bBacklog Manager\b`. This accepts bulleted, tabular, and backticked lists and fails a reply that attaches a label to the wrong target on separate lines. Add a separate negated `output-matches` rejecting a target identified by file path, with a truthful-denial guard, for example `(?i)(?<!(?:\b(?:not|never)|n[\x27\u2019]t)\s+(?:\w+\s+){0,2})\bagent\s*:\s*\W{0,3}[\w/-]*\.agent\.md`.
* Evidence: `.github/agents/project-planning/`hve-core:ux-ui-designer` demonstrates label, agent, prompt (slash command), and send (auto-send) fields together.

### Check 7: Tool Restrictions Format

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: when an agent declares `tools:`, the value MUST be a list of valid tool identifiers available in this VS Code context. When the `tools:` field is omitted, the agent inherits the default tool set.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the artifact and ask whether its declared tools fit the role its description states, distinguishing the declared grants from what the host actually enforces.
* Grader recommendation: `prompt` with a rubric that rewards reasoning from the artifact's own declared tools and description, rejects invented tools, and rejects claims that a tool grant enforces a boundary only the artifact's own policy provides. Keep the rubric's expected tool families out of the stimulus text so the reply is not taught the answer.
* Evidence: a subagent under `.github/agents/**/subagents/` such as `.github/agents/hve-core/subagents/`hve-core:rpi-researcher` shows the `tools:` field shape.

### Check 8: Subagent Invocation by Human-Readable Name

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: parent-agent invocation text MUST reference a subagent by the human-readable `name:` from the subagent's frontmatter (for example "Run `hve-core:pptx-subagent`"). Invocation by filename or by file path is non-conforming.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the parent artifact and ask how it invokes one of its declared subagents.
* Grader recommendation: `output-matches` asserting the subagent's human-readable name, for example `(?i)\bPowerPoint Subagent\b`. Add a separate negated `output-matches` rejecting invocation by filename, guarded against truthful denial including contractions, for example `(?i)(?<!(?:\b(?:not|never|without)|n[\x27\u2019]t)\s+(?:\w+\s+){0,3})\b(?:runs?|invokes?|invoked|calls?)\s+\S*\.agent\.md\b`.
* Evidence: `.github/agents/experimental/`hve-core:pptx` invokes `hve-core:pptx-subagent` by its human-readable name.

### Check 9: Phase and Step Heading Consistency

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Outcome and Structure and Writing.
* Testable behavior: phases MUST take the form `### Phase N: Short Summary` and steps MUST take the form `### Step N: Short Summary`, each with a descriptive summary after the colon.
* Suggested stimulus: stage the artifact and ask for its phase or step headings in order, exactly as written.
* Grader recommendation: `output-matches` asserting every expected heading summary in order with any intervening text, for example `(?is)Phase\s+1:\s+Platform and Intent Classification[\s\S]*Phase\s+2:\s+Workflow Dispatch[\s\S]*Phase\s+3:\s+Summary and Handoff` for the Evidence artifact below. Sequence is the behavior under test, so this is the one check where an ordered pattern is correct; it still accepts numbered, bulleted, and backticked lists.
* Evidence: `.github/agents/project-planning/`hve-core:backlog-manager` demonstrates the heading shape across phases.
