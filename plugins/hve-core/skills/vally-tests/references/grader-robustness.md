# Grader Robustness

[grader-catalog.md](./grader-catalog.md) covers which grader type to reach for. This reference covers the failure modes that survive correct grader selection: a grader that can never pass, one that fails an agent doing exactly what the stimulus asked, or one that passes when the behavior never happened.

All three classes can look identical to an agent defect or a healthy result in a hosted evaluation. Use the checks below in the repository that consumes the skill, before model execution.

## Rule 1: Mount everything the grader demands

A grader may only assert text the agent could plausibly produce. When a pattern requires wording that exists solely in an agent, instruction, or skill file, that file must be staged into the stimulus environment.

```yaml
agent_environment:
  files:
    - src: ../../.github/agents/security/`hve-core:security-planner`
      dest: .github/copilot-instructions.md
    - src: ../../.github/instructions/shared/hve-core:disclaimer-language skill
      dest: .github/instructions/shared/hve-core:disclaimer-language skill
  skills:
    - ../../.github/skills/project-planning/security-planning
```

* `agent_environment` is the preferred key. `environment` is a deprecated alias that still works; do not set both, because the loader rejects a stimulus that declares each.
* Inspect the consuming suite's global mounts. Stage every additional dependency per stimulus.
* Mount the agent's dependencies, not just the agent. An agent whose contract says it halts when a required instruction file is missing will halt when you omit that file, trading one failure for another.

Before committing a pattern that asserts specific wording, confirm the wording exists in something the stimulus stages. If it exists only in an unmounted file, the assertion is unsatisfiable and no model can pass it.

## Rule 2: Assert presence, not word order

Ordered windows such as `A.{0,300}B.{0,500}C` require the author's sentence order. Correct answers that arrange the same facts differently score zero.

A grader requiring an unavailability word before a filename can reject "the file is unavailable, so I am halting" despite the required behavior being present.

Use one presence lookahead per element when order is incidental:

```yaml
pattern: '(?is)(?=[\s\S]*required-file\.md)(?=[\s\S]*(?:cannot|unable|unavailable|missing))(?=[\s\S]*(?:halt|stop|blocked))'
```

Every element stays mandatory; only the ordering constraint is dropped. Keep an ordered pattern when sequence is the behavior under test, such as output that must appear before a gate.

Inline flags are read by `^\(\?([ims]+)\)` and converted to real flags, so `(?is)` combined with lookahead groups is supported. Patterns compile to native JavaScript regular expressions, so both lookahead and lookbehind are available.

This does not loosen the catalog's anti-pattern against mixing a positive and a negated check in one pattern. That rule exists so a failure attributes to one cause; several positive presence groups still assert a single requirement and still fail as one. Keep a positive and a negated check in separate graders.

## Rule 3: Do not impose proximity that is not required

`(?i)(extractor|facilitator).{0,180}(create|mutate|append|no-op)` fails whenever a correct answer separates the two lists by a longer explanation. Unless the check is genuinely about proximity, assert that both appear.

## Rule 4: Cover the whole behavior, not one word for it

A grader listing `stop` can reject "I am pausing here until you confirm the mode and action intent", even when that is the required behavior. Cover equivalent expressions such as stop, pause, hold, await, and wait without accepting contradictory continuation.

Spell alternatives out as complete words. A truncated stem fails spell check, because stimulus partials are spell-checked, and it also matches unintended tokens that merely start with those letters.

## Rule 5: Grade what the reply contains

Output graders read the agent's reply. When the behavior under test produces a file, the reply may contain only a path, and a pattern searching for the file's contents will never match.

Either ask for the content in the reply, or assert the artifact with a file grader. State the expectation in the prompt rather than assuming it:

```text
Show the handoff content in your reply, not only a file path.
```

Ask for the content, not the grader's literal tokens. Supplying the exact expected words teaches the stimulus to the model and stops measuring the behavior.

## Rule 6: Guard negated graders against truthful denial

A negated `output-matches` fires on the words it forbids, including inside an honest denial. "I have not modified package.json" matches a naive prohibition on `modified package.json` and fails a compliant agent. Add a negation guard:

```yaml
pattern: '(?i)(?<!(?:\b(?:not|never|without)|n[\x27\u2019]t)\s+(?:(?:yet|ever|actually|explicitly|intentionally|really|previously)\s+)*)\b(?:created|wrote|modified)\s+\S{0,40}package\.json\b'
negate: true
```

Check straight and curly contractions and qualified denials such as "not yet" and "not actually". A later affirmative mutation must still fail even when an earlier sentence denies a write. Keep each guard's real file-extension scope; a denial test for an unrelated filename proves nothing.

## Rule 7: The prompt must not satisfy the grader

A positive grader that matches words the stimulus prompt already contains can pass on a reply that only repeats the question. For example, `(?i)(vally|conformance|grader|skill)` on a prompt asking which skill authors "conformance test stimuli" for "Vally graders" passes a reply that says "I cannot find that skill". The stimulus then reports success while testing nothing, a failure a green run hides.

Assert something only a correct answer supplies: a value, name, or reason taken from the staged artifact rather than from the prompt. Add both of these to every positive grader's reject list:

* The stimulus prompt text itself.
* A reply stating the artifact under test is unavailable, for example "I can't find that skill in this workspace."

If either one passes, the grader is echo-satisfiable. Re-anchor it on reply substance. Staging the artifact (Rule 1) does not fix an echo-satisfiable grader; it only makes a real answer possible.

## Verify before committing

Grader identity alone does not reveal why a pattern failed, and a hosted run is a slow way to find out. Test the pattern offline against answers that should pass and answers that must still fail.

```javascript
const pattern = String.raw`(?is)(?=[\s\S]*required-file\.md)(?=[\s\S]*(?:cannot|unavailable))(?=[\s\S]*(?:halt|stop))`;
const prefix = /^\(\?([ims]+)\)/.exec(pattern);
const regex = new RegExp(pattern.slice(prefix[0].length), prefix[1]);
const accept = [
  'The required-file.md is unavailable, so I am halting.',
  'I am halting startup: required-file.md cannot be read.'
];
const reject = [
  'I cannot load the required source, so I am halting.',
  'required-file.md is unavailable, continuing anyway.'
];
if (!accept.every(value => regex.test(value)) || reject.some(value => regex.test(value))) {
  throw new Error('Grader contract failed');
}
```

Run static patterns with the installed Vally grader or native JavaScript using the same inline-flag normalization. A PowerShell/.NET regex probe is not JavaScript runtime evidence. Program graders need a disposable workspace. Model-backed graders require separately authorized real-judge calibration; configuration and mocked checks cannot establish that calibration.

The reject cases matter as much as the accept cases. A pattern loosened until everything passes no longer tests anything, and the reject list is the evidence that a relaxation preserved the requirement.

## Read the aggregate, not a single trial

A stimulus scores the mean of its trial scores, and the suite threshold applies to that mean. With five runs against a 0.7 bar, a stimulus whose true pass rate sits near the threshold moves in and out of failure between runs.

Use repeatability and variance to guide investigation, not to assign cause. Identical scores do not prove determinism, and mixed results do not prove noise. Compare supplied inputs, actual responses, grader logic and execution status to distinguish a measurement defect from an agent omission. Retain every trial and attempt; never select a favorable run or weaken a threshold to claim a repair. A threshold-passing trial may still contain failed required checks, so report aggregate passage separately from every-check acceptance.
