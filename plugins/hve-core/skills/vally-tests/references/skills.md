# Skills Conformance Checks

## Overview

This reference enumerates the nine conformance checks the `vally-tests` skill knows how to express for `SKILL.md` artifacts. Skill contracts emphasize the metadata that drives semantic invocation, the structure that supports progressive disclosure, and the portability constraints that let a skill move between in-repo, extension, and plugin distribution contexts.

The canonical eval target for this kind, per `eval-suite-routing.md`, is `evals/behavior-conformance/skill-behavior.eval.yaml`. New stimulus blocks are appended to its `stimuli:` array, tagged `tags.advisory: true`, and labeled with `tags.skill: <skill-slug>` and `tags.shape: knowledge | tool-trigger | bleed-detection`. The DR-03 fallback to `evals/skill-quality/eval.yaml` applies when the primary target is absent at consumption time; a fallback append carries a leading YAML comment `# Deferred cutover per DR-03; see WI-12.` per `eval-suite-routing.md`. Authors MUST run every candidate stimulus through `refusal-taxonomy.md` before emission and refuse any match.

Grader identifiers below use the Vally CLI 0.9.0 catalog (`semantic_similarity`, `contains`, `regex`, `json_schema`) per `grader-catalog.md`. Where the research phrasing recommended `output-matches`, the equivalent here is `regex`; where it recommended `llm-grader`, the equivalent is `semantic_similarity`.

## Conformance Checks

### Check 1: Required Frontmatter Fields

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: SKILL.md frontmatter MUST include a `name:` field in lowercase kebab-case AND a concise, non-empty `description:` field (aim near 120 characters; modest overage is acceptable when it improves routing clarity).
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant to identify a named skill by its frontmatter `name:` and `description:` values.
* Grader recommendation: `regex` with pattern `(?m)^name:\s*['"]?[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*['"]?` combined with `(?m)^description:\s*['"].{1,200}`.
* Evidence: `.github/skills/experimental/vscode-playwright/SKILL.md` L1-L7 demonstrates the required metadata pair.

### Check 2: Name Matches Directory

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: the `name:` frontmatter value MUST equal the skill's directory name in lowercase kebab-case (for example a skill at `.github/skills/hve-core/vally-tests/` MUST declare `name: vally-tests`).
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant where on disk a named skill lives and to confirm that the directory matches the frontmatter name.
* Grader recommendation: `semantic_similarity` with rubric "Does the skill's frontmatter name field equal the final segment of its directory path in lowercase kebab-case?".
* Evidence: `.github/skills/experimental/vscode-playwright/SKILL.md` L1 declares `name: vscode-playwright` matching the directory.

### Check 4: H1 Title Matches Skill Purpose

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Outcome and Structure.
* Testable behavior: the SKILL.md H1 heading MUST state the skill's purpose clearly and SHOULD align in intent with the `description:` frontmatter.
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant to summarize a named skill in one sentence and compare against the H1 heading.
* Grader recommendation: `semantic_similarity` with rubric "Does the SKILL.md H1 heading describe the skill's purpose in a way that aligns with the description frontmatter?".
* Evidence: `.github/skills/experimental/vscode-playwright/SKILL.md` L10-L11 carries an H1 that matches the description's intent.

### Check 5: Required Content Sections

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Outcome and Structure.
* Testable behavior: a playbook-style skill that delegates execution to subagents MUST present its sections in the order Title (H1), Goal, Flow (or Execution), Inputs, Success criteria, Constraints, Stop rules, Handoff, and an optional response contract; a script-bearing skill MAY instead use the legacy script-oriented order (Overview, Prerequisites, Quick Start, or Architecture plus Workflow Steps, then Parameters Reference or Troubleshooting).
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant to list the section headings of a named skill in order and confirm they follow the playbook shape for a delegating skill or the script-oriented shape for a script-bearing skill.
* Grader recommendation: `semantic_similarity` with rubric "For a delegating playbook skill, do the section headings follow the playbook order (Goal, Flow, Inputs, Success criteria, Constraints, Stop rules, Handoff); for a script-bearing skill, do they follow the Overview/Prerequisites/Quick Start order?".
* Evidence: a playbook-style skill such as `.github/skills/engagement-reporting/engagement-reporting/SKILL.md` exhibits the Goal/Flow/Inputs/Success-criteria/Constraints/Stop-rules/Handoff order.

### Check 6: Relative Path Portability

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability.
* Testable behavior: operational file references within SKILL.md MUST be portable in distributed contexts. Bundled resources use skill-root-relative paths, packaged instruction directives use source-relative paths, and cross-artifact dependencies use stable artifact or skill names. Operational workspace-root `.github/` references are non-conforming; descriptive repository-shape examples and valid runtime values such as slash commands, API routes, installation destinations, and temporary-file paths are not source-tree references.
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant to enumerate operational file references inside a named skill's SKILL.md, explain how each resolves after distribution, and distinguish them from commands, routes, destinations, and descriptive examples.
* Grader recommendation: `semantic_similarity` with rubric "Do operational file references avoid workspace-root source-tree assumptions, use the portable reference form for their target, and avoid misclassifying valid runtime slash-prefixed values as source-tree paths?". Use `npm run lint:artifact-portability` for deterministic source-tree path enforcement; do not apply a blanket absolute-path regex.
* Evidence: `.github/skills/experimental/vscode-playwright/SKILL.md` references bundled resources by skill-root-relative paths, while the artifact-portability validator rejects operational workspace-root `.github/` references across distributed runtime Markdown.

### Check 7: Progressive Disclosure Structure

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Keep Context Focused.
* Testable behavior: SKILL.md SHOULD respect progressive disclosure: frontmatter holds metadata of roughly 100 tokens, the body holds activation instructions of under 5000 tokens, and large or domain-specific resources live in `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` subdirectories rather than inline.
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant whether a named skill keeps its SKILL.md body within the activation budget and which subdirectories it uses for on-demand resources.
* Grader recommendation: `semantic_similarity` with rubric "Does the skill follow progressive disclosure, with a focused SKILL.md body under the activation budget and large references moved to separate files?".
* Evidence: `.github/skills/hve-core/vally-tests/SKILL.md` body delegates regex sets and routing tables to files under `references/`.

### Check 8: Script Parity for Cross-Platform Helpers

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Keep Context Focused.
* Testable behavior: when a skill ships executable helpers, the helpers SHOULD be provided in parity pairs of a bash (`.sh`) implementation and a PowerShell (`.ps1`) implementation, unless the workflow requires Python.
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant which helper scripts a named skill ships and whether each non-Python script has both bash and PowerShell forms.
* Grader recommendation: `semantic_similarity` with rubric "If the skill ships non-Python helpers, does each helper appear in both .sh and .ps1 forms for cross-platform parity?".
* Evidence: skills under `.github/skills/` consistently pair `.sh` and `.ps1` helpers for cross-platform helpers.

### Check 9: Troubleshooting Section

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Outcome and Structure.
* Testable behavior: SKILL.md SHOULD include a Troubleshooting section that documents common failure modes and their resolutions, or that explicitly states no common issues exist.
* Suggested stimulus: ask the assistant which common issues a named skill calls out under Troubleshooting and what the recommended fix is for each.
* Grader recommendation: `regex` with pattern `(?m)^##\s+Troubleshooting\b`.
* Evidence: the `.github/skills/experimental/vscode-playwright/` skill exposes a Troubleshooting section in line with the convention.

### Check 10: Semantic Invocation Alignment

* Contract source: `hve-core:hve-builder-instructions` skill, Frontmatter and Portability and Choose Artifacts by Responsibility.
* Testable behavior: the `description:` frontmatter MUST be domain-specific enough that natural-language task descriptions matching the skill's domain (for example "extract VS Code screenshots") semantically correlate with the declared description.
* Suggested stimulus: present several phrasings of a task in the skill's domain and ask the assistant whether the named skill is the right choice for each, with justification.
* Grader recommendation: `semantic_similarity` with rubric "Is the skill's description specific and domain-focused enough that natural-language task phrasings in the domain semantically match the description?".
* Evidence: `.github/skills/experimental/vscode-playwright/SKILL.md` L2 carries a domain-specific description that pairs VS Code and Playwright.
