> **Role.** Before doing anything else, load the `hve-core:rai-planner-agent` skill with the `Skill` tool and operate under it for the rest of this task.


# RAI Plan from PRD/BRD

Activate the RAI Planner in **from-prd mode** to plan for AI-specific risk assessment for project slug `${input:project-slug}`.

## Startup

Before any phase work, check `state.json` for `disclaimerShownAt`. If `disclaimerShownAt` is `null` or `state.json` does not yet exist, display the RAI Planning CAUTION block from the `hve-core:disclaimer-language` skill verbatim and set `disclaimerShownAt` to the current ISO 8601 timestamp in `state.json`.

After the disclaimer, display the framework attribution following the Session Start Display protocol in `../../instructions/rai-planning/hve-core:rai-identity skill.` When `replaceDefaultFramework` is `false` or `state.json` does not yet exist, announce the default NIST AI RMF 1.0 framework. When `replaceDefaultFramework` is `true`, announce the custom framework by its name from `riskClassification.framework.name` in `state.json`.

## Requirements

### PRD/BRD Discovery

Scan for product and business requirements documents:

**Primary paths:**

- `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/` for PRD artifacts
- `.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/` for BRD artifacts

**Secondary scan:**

Search the workspace for files matching `*prd*`, `*brd*`, `*product-requirements*`, or `*business-requirements*` patterns.

Present discovered artifacts:

- ✅ Found artifacts with file paths and brief descriptions
- ❌ Missing artifact locations

If zero artifacts are found, fall back to capture mode and explain the switch.

### AI System Scope Extraction

Extract from the discovered artifacts:

1. Project name and AI system purpose
2. AI components and model types
3. Technology stack and deployment targets
4. Data classification and data flow
5. Stakeholder roles (developers, operators, affected individuals)
6. Intended use scenarios and user populations

### State Initialization

Create the project directory at `.copilot-tracking/rai-plans/${input:project-slug}/`.

Initialize `state.json` with:

- `entryMode` set to `"from-prd"`
- `currentPhase` set to `1`
- Pre-populated fields from the extracted scope

### Phase 1 Entry

Present the extracted AI system scope as a checklist with markers:

- ✅ Items confirmed from PRD/BRD
- ❓ Items that need clarification or are missing

Ask 3 to 5 clarifying questions that target AI-specific gaps not covered by the requirements documents, such as model selection rationale, training data provenance, fairness considerations, and unintended use scenarios.

Also ask whether the user has evaluation standards, risk indicator categories, prohibited use frameworks, or output format requirements to supply for storage in `.copilot-tracking/rai-plans/references/`.
