# Pull Request

## Goal

Turn the current branch into a review-ready GitHub pull request with a short, accurate description
and enough targeted local evidence to catch likely CI failures without running broad validation by
default.

Success means the title and body reflect the committed branch diff, the repository template is
preserved when present, changed-area preflight checks pass, any authorized preflight repairs are
committed under repository conventions, and an external pull request is created or updated only
after one final approval.

## Inputs

* `base`: Base branch or ref. Default to the remote default branch without fetching.
* `draft`: Whether a newly created pull request is a draft. Default to `false`.
* `action`: `prepare`, `create`, or `update`. Infer from the request and default to `prepare` when
  external write intent is unclear.

Use the current checked-out branch as the head. Ask only for an input that cannot be inferred and
changes the resulting pull request.

## Flow

1. Run the platform-matching script in `scripts/` to collect branch, commit, changed-file, diff-stat,
   working tree, base-divergence, and template context. Preserve the initial working-tree state as the
   exclusion boundary for later repairs. The script uses the local remote-tracking ref and does not
   fetch, merge, rebase, push, or edit the branch.
2. Stop if the repository, head branch, base ref, or merge base cannot be resolved. If the branch has
   no committed changes from the merge base, report that there is nothing to submit. Treat
   uncommitted files as excluded from the pull request and ask whether to continue only when the
   user's intent appears to include them. Before an external write, stop with sync guidance when the
   reported upstream push state is `behind` or `diverged`.
3. Inspect the committed diff from the reported merge base. Start with changed files and diff stats,
   then read the diffs that determine reviewer-visible behavior. Group related files and use
   delegation only when a large, separable diff would materially benefit from isolated review.
4. Derive the title from the branch and commits. Follow the repository's title convention when one
   exists; otherwise use a concise imperative title. Extract closing issue references only when they
   appear in branch or commit evidence.
5. Build `.copilot-tracking/pr/pr.md`. Use the discovered repository template and preserve its
   heading order, comments, and manual-review checkboxes. If no template exists, copy
   `templates/pull-request.md`. Replace instructional placeholders with verified content while
   keeping unsupported human attestations unchecked. Apply any repository instructions that match
   the pull request artifact.
6. Write for a human reviewer. Open with one plain-language summary, group the material changes by
   reviewer concern, and include only evidence-backed impact, compatibility, security, migration,
   testing, and follow-up details. Omit empty optional sections in the fallback template. Avoid a
   commit transcript, exhaustive file inventory, implementation chronology, and claims not supported
   by the diff or commits.
7. Apply the public-output guard from the applicable content-policy instructions. Do not copy private
   classifications, sensitive values, or raw suspect content into the pull request body.
8. Run the CI-confidence gate. Always run `git diff --check` against the committed branch diff, then
   match changed paths against workflow triggers and select the smallest non-mutating checks that own
   those areas from package scripts, path-scoped instructions, and the matching workflow steps. Prefer
   focused tests, syntax checks, check-mode generators, and artifact validators. Do not run full
   validation aggregates or CI-prefixed wrappers unless the user explicitly requests them. When a
   matching workflow calls a CI-prefixed wrapper, run its locally safe non-mutating component checks
   if no equivalent local-safe package command exists; the prefix alone is not a reason to skip them.
   Do not infer browser suites, service-dependent tests, security scans, or other lane-specific
   prerequisites from this component-check rule. Follow repository dependency bootstrap rules before
   dependency-backed commands.
9. Record only checks that actually ran in the pull request. Leave hosted CI checks and human review
   attestations unchecked. If a required targeted check fails, keep the prepared description and stop
   before external creation or update. Do not change branch source unless the user asks for a fix.
10. When the user asks to fix a local test or CI-confidence failure, treat that request as authority to
   commit only the resulting validated repairs. Capture the tracked and untracked working-tree baseline
   before editing, apply the smallest in-scope correction, and rerun every check affected by it. After
   the checks pass, resolve the repository's applicable commit instructions, stage only the exact
   repair delta created by this workflow, inspect the staged diff, and create one or more logical
   commits. Use Conventional Commits when the repository requires them; otherwise use its stated
   convention or a concise imperative subject. Never stage pre-existing edits, unrelated changes,
   validation logs, or the pull request body. If the repair cannot be separated safely, commit
   authority is unclear, or the commit fails, stop before push or pull request write. Do not amend,
   squash, rebase, or create an empty commit unless the user explicitly requests it.
11. After a repair commit, rerun the context collector and refresh the committed diff, title, body,
   validation evidence, divergence, and push state. For `prepare`, return the proposed title, body
   path, base and head branches, repair commits, divergence, and preflight result. For `create` or
   `update`, also search for an open pull request with the same head and base, then present the final
   title, body path, target, draft state, repair commits, validation result, and upstream push state.
   Ask once for approval covering any needed push and the pull request write.
12. After approval, push the current branch when needed and use the available GitHub integration to
   create or update the pull request. Never force-push. If an open pull request already exists, update
   it only when the requested action permits; otherwise return its URL instead of creating a
   duplicate.

## Template Rules

Resolve templates in this order:

1. A caller-specified template
2. `<repository-root>/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` or `<repository-root>/.github/pull_request_template.md`
3. A single Markdown template under `<repository-root>/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`
4. `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` or `docs/pull_request_template.md`
5. `templates/pull-request.md` in this skill

When multiple repository templates remain equally applicable, ask the user to choose. Repository
instructions may define section-specific mapping and manual-only checkboxes; apply those rules without
reintroducing a separate end-to-end workflow.

## CI Confidence

The local gate predicts likely CI outcomes; it does not claim that hosted checks passed when they did
not run. Use
these priorities:

1. Locally safe non-mutating checks from workflows whose path triggers match the changed files
2. Checks explicitly required by applicable repository instructions for the changed paths
3. Focused tests for changed executable behavior
4. Linters, type checks, parsers, or check-mode generators for changed artifacts
5. `git diff --check` for patch hygiene

Do not mark the pull request ready for external creation when a required selected check failed,
dependencies needed for that check are unavailable, or generated projections known to be required are
stale. If a matching workflow step cannot run locally because it needs a browser, service, credential,
moderation environment, or other CI-only prerequisite, record it as pending or unavailable instead of
silently omitting it. Report hosted status checks as pending after creation.

## Preflight Repair Commits

Preflight remains non-mutating until the user asks to fix a reported failure. That request authorizes
source correction and a repair-only commit, not staging other working-tree content. Use the initial and
pre-repair working-tree snapshots to distinguish existing changes from workflow-created repairs. If the
same file contains inseparable pre-existing edits, leave it unstaged and stop with the exact manual
separation needed.

Commit only after the owning checks pass. Apply repository commit instructions by their normal scope
and precedence, including required Conventional Commit type and scope, subject style, body, footer,
signing, or verification rules. Inspect the staged name-status and patch before committing, then verify
the resulting commit contains only the validated repair delta. Recollect branch context after every
repair commit because commit evidence, divergence, and push state have changed.

## Description Standard

Describe the final branch state in direct, neutral language. Give reviewers the context needed to
understand scope and risk, with the most important change first. Use short paragraphs and flat bullets
unless the repository template requires another shape. Mention files only when they help a reviewer
navigate or understand an important boundary.

Check a non-human template checkbox only when direct diff or command evidence proves its statement.
Never check a qualified-human review, security attestation, manual test, or hosted CI checkbox on the
user's behalf.

## Stop Rules

* Stop as `Blocked` when branch identity, base identity, merge base, template choice, commit authority,
   repair-delta isolation, or write authority cannot be resolved.
* Stop as `Revise` before an external write when a required targeted preflight check fails or the
   description has an unsupported claim. A requested repair remains `Revise` until affected checks pass
   and its repair-only commit succeeds.
* Stop as `Prepared` after writing and validating the local description when no external action was
  requested.
* Stop as `Created` or `Updated` only after returning the pull request URL and hosted CI state.

## Final Response

Return the outcome, title, base and head, pull request body path, repair commits, targeted checks and
results, skipped broad checks, material limitations, and pull request URL when one exists. Keep the
response brief and do not repeat the full body.
