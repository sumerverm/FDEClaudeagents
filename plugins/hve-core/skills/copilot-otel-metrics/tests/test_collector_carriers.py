"""Runtime carrier map for the shipped local Collector configuration.

Starts the pinned Collector, sends payloads that place a unique marker in every
OTLP carrier the signal model can transport, and records what the shipped
policy does to each one. The recorded map is the citable evidence behind the
minimization claims in `SECURITY.md` and the references, and it is asserted as
a regression boundary, so a configuration or image change that opens a carrier
fails here.

Absence alone proves nothing: a marker can be missing because policy dropped it
or because the exporter never renders that field. Every run is therefore paired
with a negative control that removes the content-minimization processors from
the same configuration. A marker the control does not render is `unobservable`,
never `governed`.
