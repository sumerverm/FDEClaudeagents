# Instruction Quality Requirements Catalog

The quality standard the `hve-builder` skill applies when it creates, improves, refactors, replaces, or reviews a prompt, instruction file, agent, subagent, or skill. Each requirement is a decision rule an author can apply and a reviewer can check. Mechanical validation checks structure; it does not establish instruction quality.

## Provenance

The requirements distill first-party model-provider guidance retrieved on 2026-07-25 from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, together with the Agent Skills specification, the AGENTS.md convention, and VS Code and GitHub Copilot customization documentation. That evidence is research-supported, not runtime-validated. Treat the catalog as a strong default and settle a disputed choice with target-model evaluation. Where providers disagree, the entry names the disagreement.

## How to use this catalog

* Categories are ordered as an authoring guide, not a waiver of safety, authority, or acceptance requirements. Apply every material requirement and record justified exceptions.
* Each entry is a short name, a decision rule, and an applied example. Apply the rule, not the label.
* Use the maintenance decisions below before applying Stale patterns to retire. A pattern is a review signal, not permission to remove required behavior.
* Cite requirements by category and short name (for example, "Outcome and structure: explicit success criteria") in author logs and review findings.

## Authoring and maintenance decisions

Start with the behavior the caller needs, not a preferred artifact shape. For each material instruction, identify its trigger and scope, required action or decision, observable result, authority boundary, and response to missing evidence. Put these details in the smallest useful rule or shared contract; do not require a separate section for every detail.

For an existing artifact, capture its current purpose, activation, inputs, outputs, consumers, stop conditions, and non-tool capability surface before editing. Compare proposed changes against that baseline and the caller's acceptance criteria. A shorter artifact is not an improvement if it loses a required behavior.

* Keep an instruction when it encodes a current requirement, a non-obvious convention, a safety boundary, or a demonstrated correction that is not supplied reliably elsewhere. A new explicit requirement does not need a history of failures to justify inclusion.
* Create an instruction when a required behavior has no suitable owner. Choose its artifact type and load timing before writing it, and define an observable acceptance check.
* Improve an instruction when the owner and activation remain suitable but its behavior is ambiguous, incomplete, contradictory, or unsupported. State which requirement or finding the change addresses.
* Refactor when the required behavior is correct but duplication, organization, or context placement makes it harder to follow. Preserve triggers, authority, outputs, and stop conditions; moving content requires checking that its consumers still load it.
* Replace when wording changes cannot fix an unsuitable responsibility, activation mechanism, interface, or control-flow design. Confirm the replacement and migration boundary, preserve required capabilities in the new owner, and update callers and references before retiring the old owner.
* Delete a rule when it is obsolete, contradicted by current evidence, redundant with an applicable canonical rule, or no longer serves a requirement. Identify what replaces it or why nothing must replace it. Check references, activation, and downstream consumers before deleting an artifact. Removing required behavior or changing architecture needs explicit approval; a cleanup request alone does not grant it.

These decisions can apply together to different rules or targets. Deletion is an operation within an approved mutating boundary, not a separate lifecycle mode. In read-only review, recommend dispositions without changing source. The workflow contract owns the inferred `create,improve,refactor` default, explicit mode limits, write authority, validation, and the review pass.

Before tuning wording, define the cheapest check that could reject the proposed change: a structure check for metadata, a consumer check for relocated guidance, or a representative behavioral scenario for a changed decision. Record the requirement, disposition, rationale, and evidence in the existing author or review record. Do not add process logs to the production artifact.

## 1. Agent architecture

Decide the surrounding architecture before wording any instruction. Most quality failures are architecture choices, not phrasing choices.

* Prefer the simplest viable pattern: start from one evaluated call or a fixed workflow; add autonomy only when it measurably improves an outcome. Example: ship a single evaluated prompt before proposing a multi-subagent orchestrator.
* Distinguish workflows from agents: use a predefined code path for known, repeatable routing; reserve model-directed control for open-ended tasks. Example: route known request types with a classifier; reserve an agent for open-ended debugging.
* Own the control flow: treat a reliable agent as deterministic software with model steps at explicit decision points, not a prompt plus a tool bag in a loop. Example: hand-build the loop; call the model only at the classify-and-decide step.
* One narrow job per agent: give each agent or subagent a single responsibility, and compact error signals before feeding them back. Example: summarize a stack trace to the failing assertion before re-inserting it.
* Stage gates and terminal outcomes: give every worker result a consumer and resolve one overall outcome so partial evidence cannot read as success. Example: a validation failure resolves the run to Revise, not Pass.

## 2. Outcome and structure

Write the artifact outcome-first. Role and process serve the outcome; they never replace it.

* Outcome before process: state the desired end state before any step list. Example: "Success means the bug is reproduced, fixed, covered by a test, and the changed files are listed."
* Explicit success criteria: name completion conditions an evaluation can score. Example: "Done when the targeted tests pass and the response names any skipped validation."
* Stop rules and missing evidence: define when to stop and what to do when evidence is absent, so silence never becomes an unsupported "no." Example: "If the sources do not support the claim, ask for the smallest missing source or state the gap."
* Short, bounded role: keep any persona to a line or two beside goals, success criteria, constraints, and stop rules. Example: "Role: coding assistant for this repo. Goal: implement the requested change with targeted validation."
* Clear sectioning: separate goals, constraints, outputs, and stop rules when the artifact's complexity warrants it; do not add empty ceremony to a short path-scoped convention. Example: a multi-stage skill uses distinct sections, while a small instruction file uses a concise rule list.
* Explain non-obvious reasons: give the reason for a constraint when it is not self-evident, so the model generalizes correctly. Example: "Avoid ellipses because the output is read aloud by text-to-speech."
* Positive framing: say what to do, not only what to avoid. Example: "Write prose paragraphs" rather than only "do not use bullet lists."
* One structural convention: use Markdown headings or XML-style tags consistently within an artifact; do not mix or nest them gratuitously. Providers accept both; none requires XML or calls it stale. Example: headings throughout a skill body; tags only for bounded supporting content the artifact already uses.
* Reference format follows use: prefer descriptive headings with self-contained rules for long guidance, conditional bullets for decisions, and numbered lists when order or precedence matters. Keep tables for compact comparisons. Use YAML or JSON when a parser or stable data contract needs explicit fields; XML is useful for bounded content when the host already uses it. No format guarantees better model adherence; evaluate a disputed choice on the target task.
* Emphasis matched to enforcement: reserve forceful wording for a tested, enforceable constraint with clear scope, and state each rule once. Example: keep "never expose secrets"; delete a second copy of the rule rather than strengthening it.
* Depth and length belong to runtime controls: use reasoning effort and verbosity controls when the target host exposes them; otherwise state task-specific completeness and output requirements without inventing settings. Example: require cited findings and skipped-check disclosure rather than "think harder" or "be thorough."
* Re-evaluate on model migration: move the model unchanged, pin effort to match prior depth, baseline evaluations, trim inherited emphasis that newer models over-trigger on, then re-evaluate. Example: migrate with the old prompt, baseline, then remove legacy persistence reminders that no longer help.
* Output shape matches need: add heavier formatting only when it improves comprehension or interface stability. Example: "Return JSON for the API payload; use prose for the user explanation."
* Execution status is not a verdict: use distinct vocabularies for whether work ran and whether it passed. Example: record execution as Deferred and the verdict as unavailable rather than a partial pass.

## 3. Instruction-file architecture

Route facts by load timing and authority. Always-loaded files stay short and durable; everything else is scoped or deferred.

* Dedicated agent entrypoint: keep agent instructions (AGENTS.md for cross-vendor work) separate from the human README. Example: root AGENTS.md covers setup, tests, style, security, and pull-request checks.
* Concise always-loaded files: keep root instructions short, route overflow to path-scoped rules, and use the host's published size guidance rather than a guess. Example: the root file names the commands that matter and links deeper docs.
* Durable, non-inferable facts only: include commands, non-default conventions, and gotchas; exclude anything the code or standard conventions already reveal. Example: include "run the install step before scripts" only when it is repo-specific and verified.
* Scope path-specific guidance: attach conventions that apply to some files to path or glob rules. Example: a language rule file uses `applyTo` scoped to that language's files.
* Deliberate precedence, no contradictions: plan how nested and merged instructions resolve, and never state contradictory rules across overlapping scopes. Example: a package-level file intentionally overrides the package's test command; no file says both "never use mocks" and "prefer mocks."
* Mechanically checkable where possible: prefer a runnable command over a subjective instruction. Example: "Run the auth test suite" beats "test thoroughly."
* Reference, do not copy: point to canonical files instead of pasting style guides, command inventories, or templates. Example: link the formatter config rather than restating its rules.
* Living documentation: add rules for explicit requirements or observed gaps, not speculative edge cases; prune rules that no longer serve either. Example: encode a required migration constraint before the first migration, then retire it when the migration path is removed.

## 4. Skills and referenced artifacts

Package recurring workflows and domain knowledge as skills that load on demand with progressive disclosure.

* Skills for on-demand knowledge: use a skill when knowledge should load on demand rather than always. Example: a document-processing skill bundles steps plus extraction scripts.
* Descriptions as trigger metadata: state what the skill does and when to use it; no marketing copy. Example: "Extract text and tables from PDFs and fill PDF forms. Use when the request mentions PDFs or forms."
* Compact skill body: keep the body to the workflow and move detail to references, within the specification's published size guidance. Example: the body lists the workflow; a reference holds the full schema.
* Shallow reference chains: keep references relative and one level deep. Example: link from the body to `references/api.md`, not through a nested chain.
* Scripts for deterministic subtasks: move deterministic work into bundled scripts; code is cheaper and more reliable than token-by-token reasoning. Example: a parsing script returns structured output for the model to inspect.
* Clear intended use per file: state whether each bundled file is read, executed, or copied. Example: "Run the normalize script; read the edge-cases reference only on validation failure."
* Examples by need, not habit: start zero-shot for a reasoning model. Add a few diverse, consistently formatted examples when the output requirement or a measured gap justifies them; remove a group that stops changing behavior. Example: ship the rule zero-shot; add one valid and one invalid example after a trace shows format drift.
* Templates as referenced assets: store templates as files referenced by path, not prose pasted into prompts. Example: reference a pull-request template asset from the instructions.
* Audit third-party skills: treat an installed skill like software; read its body, scripts, references, and network calls before use. Example: review bundled scripts and any network fetches before adopting a shared skill.
* Validate structure mechanically: run the available structure and frontmatter validator. Example: run the repository skill validator in the pipeline.

## 5. Agents and subagents

Treat delegation as an architecture decision. Delegate isolated, high-volume, or verification work to focused subagents; keep tightly coupled iteration in the main conversation; reuse before authoring.

* Delegate only when isolation pays: delegate work that is independent and large enough to repay its dispatch, such as fresh-context review, high-volume discovery, disposable context, or a distinct model responsibility. Keep single-file edits, a few tool calls, routine self-verification, and evolving shared context in the main thread. Current models over-delegate, so this threshold is a real control. Example: delegate an independent research lane; fix a one-line typo inline.
* Design the agentic loop: define dispatch inputs, owned evidence, return shape, and the step that consumes the result. Run independent work in parallel and chain dependent work. Example: dispatch a research subagent, then a reviewer, then act on both returns.
* Reuse subagents first: survey existing subagents and prefer adjusting one over authoring a new one. Example: reuse the shared research subagent instead of writing another.
* One narrow purpose per subagent: specialize each subagent by description, prompt, and model. Example: a reviewer subagent reviews diff risks only.
* Descriptions drive routing: write the description so a parent can decide when to delegate. Example: "Use after code changes to find correctness and security gaps."
* Model profile from responsibility: `model:` is optional and omitted by default; an omitted value inherits the parent (subagent) or the session selection (agent or prompt). A High responsibility omits it unless the caller supplies a model. Declare it only for a stable Medium or Low profile, as a scalar on agents and subagents or an ordered fallback list on prompts, and resolve current model names from GitHub's Copilot model documentation by the procedure in [artifact-types.md](artifact-types.md) rather than copying them from another artifact. Example: omit `model:` for a reviewer that inherits its parent; pin a literal mechanical runner to a currently listed low-cost model.
* Bounded, condensed return: return only the fields the consumer needs and write full detail to an evidence artifact when required. Use a numeric budget only when the caller or a measured host constraint supplies one. State whether nested dispatch is permitted. Example: "Return the file list, decisions, and blockers; write the full trace to the evidence path."
* Fresh-context, bounded review: verify with a reviewer that sees the diff and criteria, not the author's reasoning, and tell it what to ignore, because a reviewer prompted to find gaps over-reports. Example: "Review the change against the plan; report correctness gaps only. Ignore style unless it breaks a stated requirement."
* Preserve the existing capability surface: in improve and refactor work, keep existing non-tool capability-bearing frontmatter unless the caller requests a change or verified evidence supports one. The workflow contract owns the approval route. Example: keep an established `agents:` dependency set unless approved evidence supports a change.
* Memory by decision: add persistent memory only when the subagent needs it; memory adds read and write capability. Example: give a conventions subagent project memory; give a one-off review none.

### Tool-configuration boundary

Canonical statement; other hve-builder surfaces reference it by name.

Agent and subagent `tools:` configuration is a user-managed opaque boundary. HVE Builder does not inspect, compare, infer from, or use it in authoring, review, or validation decisions. When the caller supplies an exact configuration, reproduce it verbatim without assessing it.

The boundary covers only selection of an agent tool set. Generic tool API and schema design, structured output, native registration, untrusted-output handling, secret handling, and risky-action confirmation remain in scope.

## 6. Tool schemas and structured outputs

Tool and output schemas are prompts. The interface between the model and its actions determines tool-use reliability.

* Tool definitions are prompts: write tool names, descriptions, and parameters as carefully as the system prompt. Example: describe a lookup tool as if onboarding a new hire.
* Pass the intern test: a capable newcomer could use the tool from its definition alone. Example: rename an ambiguous parameter and state its source and format.
* Make invalid states unrepresentable: use enums and object structure so bad inputs cannot be expressed. Example: use an on/off enum instead of two independent booleans.
* Strict schema conformance: enable strict mode and structured outputs where supported. Example: all fields required, no extra properties, structured output over best-effort JSON.
* Training-distribution formats: choose formats close to naturally occurring text; avoid counting or escaping overhead. Example: prefer a contextual or full-file patch over a line-count-dependent diff.
* Native tool registration: register tool interfaces natively instead of describing them in prose and parsing the output. Example: register a function interface natively, not in the system prompt.
* Consolidate and namespace: combine always-sequential calls into one tool, and prefix related tools to reduce selection ambiguity. Example: one scheduling tool wraps lookup plus event creation; prefixed search tools replace two identically named ones.
* High-signal outputs: return concise, meaningful results with pagination, truncation, and actionable errors. Example: return matching log lines with context, not the whole file.
* Runtime context stays in code: do not ask the model for values code already holds; keep credentials and handles in code. Example: pass only the needed facts through tools, not database handles.
* Handle refusals and unrelated input: define the refusal path and the out-of-schema path explicitly. Example: return a not-applicable status with empty fields when input is unrelated.

## 7. Context and memory

Context is a finite resource that degrades as it grows.

* Smallest sufficient context: keep context high-signal and minimal, the smallest token set that still fully supports the behavior. Example: prefer a path and a query over pasted full documents.
* Curate tool results: return only what the next step needs, summarize or drop stale results, and prefer identifiers over inlined payloads. Example: return matching lines with context and drop superseded results.
* Just-in-time retrieval: resolve dynamic content through lightweight references combined with some upfront context. Example: store a docs path; read it only when its details matter.
* Stable content before variable content: place reusable, static content early and volatile request content later; this aids long-context comprehension and matches prefix caching. Example: put instructions, schemas, and reference material before the request.
* Deliberate long-horizon technique: choose compaction, structured notes, or a subagent explicitly for a long task, and state what must survive the boundary. A custom compaction summary replaces the default, so it must carry the state the default would keep and say whether tools may run during compaction. Example: export the decision record and open items before compaction.
* Structured state: persist important state in a structured format; treat the agent as a reducer over explicit state. Example: a status file tracks pass, fail, and not-started across context windows.
* Reset after repeated failures: start fresh with a sharper prompt after repeated failed corrections, preserving only confirmed facts. Example: after two failed fixes, reset with the confirmed facts.
* Ground code claims in files read: do not speculate about code that has not been opened. Example: "I need to read the auth module before explaining its flow."

## 8. Evaluation and validation

Behavioral claims need evidence. Build the check before iterating on wording.

* Evaluations before heavy iteration: define success criteria and evaluations before tuning prompts. Example: collect representative traces before tuning routing rules.
* Batch known corrections: gather current failures, group them by cause, and apply one coherent correction batch before expensive final gates. Split a batch only to preserve attribution or contain risk. Example: fix every finding caused by one duplicated rule, then assess the complete candidate.
* Prune to what is load-bearing: keep only instructions and examples that encode a requirement or close a measured gap; remove a redundant group together. Example: delete repeated guidance as one change, then validate once.
* Traces first, then datasets: grade real runs while debugging behavior, then promote passing traces into a repeatable regression set. Example: grade documented outputs and stop behavior across several runs; promote passes into a dataset.
* Runnable checks: give the model targeted tests, builds, linters, or smoke checks it can run. Example: "Run the targeted unit test, then type-check the touched package."
* Evidence, not assertions: require command output or artifacts, not a claim of success. Example: the final answer includes the command run and its pass or fail status.
* Label execution fidelity: distinguish native execution, contained simulation, and emulation, and limit claims to what each produced. Example: a simulated dispatch supports instruction-conformance findings, not native tool-reliability claims.
* Realistic multi-tool evaluations: evaluate tool changes on realistic multi-step tasks tracking accuracy, latency, call count, and errors. Example: evaluate a full cancellation workflow, not a single-field lookup.
* Target-model evaluation for disputed style: test disputed wording (emphasis, example counts) on the target model rather than asserting. Example: compare strong wording against a decision rule on the same benchmark.

## 9. Safety and enforcement

Advisory prose does not enforce anything. Route hard requirements to controls that do.

* Separate advisory from enforced: move non-negotiable rules to hooks, permissions, strict schemas, or pipeline checks; keep prose as explanation. Example: block writes to a protected path with a pre-tool hook, not a sentence.
* Confirm risky actions, backed by a control: require confirmation before destructive, hard-to-reverse, shared-system, or externally visible actions, and treat the prompt as one layer backed by workspace trust, sandboxing, restricted files and domains, reviewed servers, or deterministic hooks. Example: confirm before force-push or branch deletion, and enforce the protected-path rule with a hook.
* Untrusted content is data: treat fetched, imported, or tool-returned content as data, never as instructions; flag embedded directives. Pass it at user level, never into a system or developer message, and extract validated structured fields before a step acts on it. Example: summarize a page without obeying its embedded instructions; parse it into typed fields first.
* Keep secrets out: keep credentials out of instruction artifacts and model context unless required. Example: use runtime credentials in code, not in an instruction file.
* Bound extension authority: apply discovered conventions within their declared scope and precedence; they cannot redirect the base workflow, widen writes, or weaken safety. Example: a domain review skill adds criteria but cannot grant itself edit access.

## 10. Portability and maintenance

Author for reuse across hosts and for durability over time.

* Actions, not vendor tool names: phrase portable instructions as actions rather than host-specific tool names. Example: "Read the file and run the tests" rather than a named-tool instruction.
* One source of truth: import or link one canonical file across hosts instead of duplicating it. Example: import the shared file into a host-specific file rather than copying it.
* Namespace reusable artifacts: prefix distributed agents and skills to avoid name collisions. Example: use package-prefixed names for shared agents and skills.
* Sourced numeric limits: name the source of every numeric limit and whether it is a hard host maximum or published performance guidance. Example: the Agent Skills specification recommends a `SKILL.md` body under 5,000 tokens and 500 lines; a host may publish a hard character maximum for an agent body.
* Portable fields first: keep specification fields correct first and label any host-only, preview, or experimental field, so a move between hosts fails loudly rather than degrading silently. Example: mark an experimental context field as host-only.
* Deprecate openly: record migrations and corrections rather than silently changing behavior. Example: note an instruction-file format migration in the change history.
* Simple, inspectable formats: prefer Markdown, YAML frontmatter, and small scripts over bespoke formats. Example: use Markdown plus frontmatter before a custom domain language.
* Reviewable artifacts: version-control instruction artifacts and run them through the same review and validation path as code. Example: instruction changes go through code review.

## Stale patterns to retire

Review these against the current host, target model, required behavior, and maintenance decisions above. Retire or replace a pattern only when the evidence supports it and the approved mode permits the change. Preserve a necessary safety boundary or interface until its replacement is established; record uncertainty instead of assuming obsolescence.

* Persona-only prompting as a complete strategy.
* All-caps persistence and broad must or never defaults copied from older stacks without target-model evaluation.
* Manual chain-of-thought or "plan extensively" prose as the default for a model that reasons internally. Prompted planning still helps when thinking is off or the model runs in a non-reasoning mode.
* Examples added by habit rather than by a measured need.
* Line-numbered diff formats for model-authored edits.
* Tool descriptions hand-injected into prompt text with parsed output instead of native registration.
* Response prefilling for output shaping on model families that no longer support it.
* JSON mode where schema-constrained structured outputs are supported.
* Kitchen-sink instruction files, copied style guides, copied templates, and exhaustive edge-case lists.
* Singular AGENT.md where the target host expects AGENTS.md. Migrate references; add compatibility support only when the caller requests it.
* Unsourced length ceilings and invented universal caps.
* Fixed iteration counts as quality theater; use evidence-backed completion and progress gates. Tie each review to an identified candidate revision without forbidding parent-owned correction of demonstrated defects.
* Model names pinned for a High responsibility, copied from another artifact, or chosen without first selecting a responsibility-based profile.
* Calling simulation or emulation native runtime validation.
