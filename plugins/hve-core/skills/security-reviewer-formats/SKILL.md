# Security Reviewer Formats — Skill Entry

This `SKILL.md` is the **entrypoint** for the security reviewer format specifications skill.

The skill provides shared format templates and data contracts used by security, accessibility,
and RAI review orchestrators and their subagents. Each reference file covers a focused area of
the reporting pipeline.

## Normative references

1. [Report Formats](references/report-formats.md) — VULN_REPORT_V1, PLAN_REPORT_V1, and RAI_REPORT_V1 templates.
2. [Finding Formats](references/finding-formats.md) — Security and RAI finding, verification, and collection formats.
3. [Completion Formats](references/completion-formats.md) — Scan status, completion, RAI response, and terminal error formats.
4. [Severity Definitions](references/severity-definitions.md) — Standard severity level definitions for all OWASP skill assessments.

## Skill layout

* `SKILL.md` — this file (skill entrypoint).
