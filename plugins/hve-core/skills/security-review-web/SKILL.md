> **Role.** Before doing anything else, load the `hve-core:security-reviewer` skill with the `Skill` tool and operate under it for the rest of this task.

> **Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`
>
> Parse the arguments above (typically `key=value` form, see the argument hint) into: `{{scope}}`. A missing optional value means its documented default.


# Web Vulnerability Scan

> [!CAUTION]
> This prompt is an **assistive tool only** and does not replace professional security tooling (SAST, DAST, SCA, penetration testing, compliance scanners) or qualified human review. All AI-generated vulnerability findings **must** be reviewed and validated by qualified security professionals before use. AI outputs may contain inaccuracies, miss critical threats, or produce recommendations that are incomplete or inappropriate for your environment.

## Inputs

* {{scope}}: (Optional) Specific component or directory path to focus the assessment on.

## Requirements

* Skip codebase classification and profiling entirely.
* Apply `owasp-top-10` directly using the `target-skill` fast-path. This bypasses the Codebase Profiler and proceeds directly to the Skill Assessor with the `owasp-top-10` skill.
* When `{{scope}}` is provided, limit analysis to files within the specified directory or component.
* Run in `audit` mode using the standard assessment and verification workflow.
