# SSSC from Security Plan

## Startup

Display the SSSC Planning CAUTION block from the `hve-core:disclaimer-language` skill verbatim at the start of every new project and whenever `disclaimerShownAt` is `null` in `state.json`, before any questions or analysis. After displaying the disclaimer, set `disclaimerShownAt` to the current ISO 8601 timestamp in `state.json`.

After the disclaimer, display the framework attribution `OpenSSF Scorecard • SLSA Build Levels • OpenSSF Best Practices Badge • Sigstore • SBOM`. Display both the disclaimer and the attribution before any questions or analysis.

Activate the SSSC Planner in **from-security-plan mode** for project slug `${input:project-slug}` to extend an existing Security Planner assessment with supply chain security coverage.

The SSSC Planner consults the `supply-chain-security` skill for framework and capabilities-inventory reference content (OpenSSF Scorecard, SLSA, Best Practices Badge, Sigstore, SBOM); do not restate those tables in this prompt.

## Inputs

* `${input:project-slug}`: (Optional) Project slug for the SSSC plan directory. When omitted, derive from the discovered security plan project name.

## Requirements

### Pre-Scan

Scan the workspace for Security Planner artifacts and supporting context:

**Primary paths:**

* `.copilot-tracking/security-plans/` for Security Planner project subdirectories. Look for `state.json` within each subdirectory. If multiple plans exist, present all candidates to the user for selection.

Also scan the shared supporting context sources defined in `hve-core:sssc-planner-instructions` skill.

Present pre-scan results as a checklist:

* ✅ Discovered security plans and supporting context with file paths and brief descriptions
* ❌ Expected sources that were not found

If zero Security Planner artifacts are found, fall back to capture mode and explain the switch.

### Scope Extraction

Read the selected Security Planner `state.json` and completed artifacts. Extract:

1. Technology stack and deployment targets
2. Compliance requirements and regulatory drivers
3. Threat model findings and operational buckets
4. Identified security controls and gaps
5. Cross-domain mapping from application-level threats to dependency and build pipeline priorities

### Initialization

Create the project directory at `.copilot-tracking/sssc-plans/${input:project-slug}/`.

Write `state.json` with `entryMode` set to `"from-security-plan"`, `currentPhase` set to `1`, `securityPlannerLink` set to the path of the source security plan, preserving `disclaimerShownAt` if already set, and remaining fields populated from the extracted security plan context.

### Phase 1 Entry

Present the extracted scope as a checklist with markers:

* ✅ Items confirmed from the Security Planner artifacts
* ❓ Items that need clarification or are missing

Then invite the user into a Phase 1 conversation with 3 to 5 facilitative clarifying questions targeting supply chain gaps not covered by the security plan, such as package manager inventory, CI/CD pipeline topology, release strategy, signing posture, SBOM tooling, and Best Practices Badge readiness. Use confirmation-and-refinement phrasing rather than directives.
