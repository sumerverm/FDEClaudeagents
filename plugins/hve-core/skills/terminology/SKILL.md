# Terminology

Apply canonical spellings for names, products, and teams.

## How to Use

Read `stakeholders` and `terminology` from `engagement.yaml` when writing or
reviewing reports. Use each configured canonical term instead of its listed
variants.

Do not add engagement-specific content to this packaged instruction. When a
configured term is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify it in `engagement.yaml`.
When `terminology` is absent or empty, preserve source spellings.
