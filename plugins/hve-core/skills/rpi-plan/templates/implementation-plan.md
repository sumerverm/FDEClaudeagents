* Plan date: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

## Executive Summary

* Bottom line: {{approachable_evidence_based_explanation_of_what_the_plan_will_implement}}
* Why this matters: {{practical_effect_on_the_users_goal}}
* Planning result: {{complete_partial_blocked_or_needs_clarification_with_plain_language_reason}}

### What You May Not Know

* {{important_context_dependency_risk_or_constraint_and_why_it_matters}}

<!-- Add a Further Reading subsection only when an evidence-backed authoritative external link materially improves understanding. -->
<!-- Use optional underline only when renderer support is confirmed and essential emphasis requires it: {{renderer_supported_underline_open}}**{{essential_text}}**{{renderer_supported_underline_close}}. Otherwise, use **{{essential_text}}**. -->

## Phase Checklist

<!-- Add both overall diagrams once the phases are stable and before the critique runs. Follow references/planning.md for state comparison and styling; reuse IDs for corresponding elements across all views. -->
<!-- Reuse the initialization line unchanged in every diagram; before critique, check the emitted fontFamily and fontSize values and correct malformed or nested values to the prescribed strings. -->

### Before

<!-- Show only evidence-backed pre-change elements and relationships. For greenfield work, show surrounding context or label the capability as absent; identify unknown state rather than inventing it. -->

```

### After

<!-- Show the intended result of all phases. Omit removed elements and obsolete edges; label added nodes with Added: and retain their dashed borders. -->

<!-- Implementation may insert a `Guidance:` block immediately after `Details:` in a later task when earlier work created something that task needs and the plan did not already name it. -->
<!-- Open decisions for a task belong in Planning Decisions and Feedback; risks and questions belong in Risks and Open Questions. Name the affected Pxx-Txx in those rows instead of adding per-task status blocks. -->
<!-- Wrap code, commands, symbols, and not-yet-created paths in backticks. Link existing files and folders with the workspace-relative path as the link text and a path relative to this plan file as the destination. -->

## User Decisions and Requirements

### Confirmed User Direction

Keep this as a concise freeform list. Preserve the user's meaning and add source pointers only when useful.

* {{user_decision_or_requirement_with_optional_source_pointer}}

### Planning Decisions and Feedback

<!-- Group one decision by default. Combine decisions only when they share a choice, evidence, and consequences or must be resolved together. -->

| Group  | Decision or feedback item | Status                                                     | Owner                                         | Rationale or input needed          | Evidence           | Planning impact                                |

## Goals

The planner synthesizes and maintains these goals from the user list and evidence.

* {{goal}}

## Scope and Non-Goals

The planner synthesizes and maintains these current boundaries from the user list and evidence.

### In Scope

* {{in_scope_outcome}}

### Non-Goals

* {{out_of_scope_item}}

## Functional Requirements

The planner synthesizes and maintains these current requirements from the user list and evidence.

* FR-{{nnn}}: {{observable_behavior_capability_workflow_step_user_action_or_system_response}}

## Non-Functional Requirements

The planner synthesizes and maintains these current requirements from the user list and evidence.

* NFR-{{nnn}}: {{measurable_quality_property}}
  * Objective threshold or evaluation condition: {{objective_threshold_or_evaluation_condition}}
  * Operating condition or verification approach, if needed: {{concise_condition_or_objective_verification}}

## Critique Disposition

Record the critique setting, status, verdict, finding dispositions, and any explicitly accepted residual risk. Keep this section outside user decisions and current planning synthesis.

* Earlier critiques: {{none_or_earlier_critique_paths}}
* Limitations: {{none_or_run_limitation_and_next_action}}

<!-- Keep every finding row. A follow-up critique adds rows or updates dispositions without deleting earlier findings. -->

## Artifact Self-Check

* [ ] Executive Summary, What You May Not Know, and the Phase Checklist come first and are understandable without reading the supporting sections.
* [ ] Confirmed direction, grouped decisions, readiness, goals, scope, requirements, risks, and dependencies are current and consistent with the Phase Checklist.
* [ ] Planning decision participation and provenance are recorded; user-owned and user-retained groups have persisted answers, while agent-owned groups have evidence-backed rationales or honest blockers.
* [ ] Functional and non-functional requirements are current, and every `FR-nnn` and `NFR-nnn` is cited by at least one task's Requirements.
* [ ] Every `Pxx` has Goals, Dependencies, and a phase diagram that highlights its part of After with any labeled removal context. Every `Pxx-Txx` has Goals, Requirements, Details, References, and Dependencies.
* [ ] Task Goals describe observable behavior, capability, or state without prescribing unsupported implementation steps. Details and References ground the implementer; examples are illustrative unless a requirement or contract makes them binding.
* [ ] Open decisions, risks, and questions live in their tables with the affected `Pxx-Txx` named; no task carries a separate status block.
* [ ] Code, commands, and symbols use backticks. Existing files and folders are Markdown links whose text is the workspace-relative path and whose destination resolves from this plan file.
* [ ] Before reflects the evidence-backed pre-change baseline; After reflects the intended result of all phases. Corresponding elements and phase diagrams reuse stable node IDs, with added and removed work distinguishable without color.
* [ ] Every emitted initialization object has the prescribed string values for themeVariables.fontFamily and themeVariables.fontSize. All diagrams use theme-aware styling, with explicit text colors on custom fills. Dual-theme rendering evidence or its preview limitation is recorded.
* [ ] Risks, open questions, blockers, critique findings, and accepted residual risks have owners and next actions.
* [ ] The critique setting and provenance are recorded. The critique ran on the implementation-ready plan or was skipped by user or parent direction, and every `PC-xxx` has a disposition or accepted residual risk.
* [ ] Readiness does not rely on a critique that returned no result.
* [ ] Planning execution, readiness, continuation owner, gates, next action, and implementation paths are complete and consistent.
* [ ] Follow-Up Items remain outside active plan completion and acceptance claims.
* Checked sections: {{list_of_checked_sections}}
* Missing or limited sections: {{missing_or_limited_sections_or_none}}

## Follow-Up Items

* None

<!-- When an implementation-discovered item is added, replace `None` with the item, why it is outside immediate scope, and its owner or next action. Do not add it to active Pxx or Pxx-Txx completion or acceptance claims. -->

## Handoff

* Authoritative implementation handoff: Planning Readiness and Next Step
