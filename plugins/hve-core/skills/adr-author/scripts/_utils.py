"""Shared path-safety helpers for adr-author scripts.

Consolidates the path-traversal guard and allow-root containment check that
were previously duplicated (with subtle divergences) across the skill's
scripts. The canonical ``safe_resolve`` rejects ``..`` segments using a
cross-platform check and resolves both the candidate path and every allow-root
before the containment test so the guard remains symlink-safe.
