# Accessibility Skill Security Model

This model covers the Path A axe CLI wrapper (`scripts/scan.py`), the Path B Playwright and Guidepup/NVDA runtime (`scripts/runtime_a11y/` and its Node runner), generated evidence, and offline design-intent verification. The trust buckets are Path A targets (B1), Path A toolchain supply chain (B2), target-derived output (B3), caller and filesystem authority (B4), design-intent verification (B5), Path B configuration and navigation (B6), Playwright, endpoint-managed Chrome, and NVDA desktop control (B7), and Path B evidence and child environment (B8). Each bucket enumerates all six STRIDE categories with the implemented mitigations and residual risks.

> **See also: repo-wide STRIDE model.** This skill participates in the repository-wide threat model at [`docs/security/security-model.md`](../../../../docs/security/security-model.md) and is registered in its [Skill Security Models](../../../../docs/security/security-model.md#skill-security-models) section.

## Executive Summary

The accessibility skill has two browser-backed scanning paths. Path A accepts explicitly authorized HTTP(S) targets or operator-selected local files and invokes the version-pinned axe CLI without a shell. Path B validates project configuration, authorizes its HTTP(S) base target, runs same-origin probes through Playwright's system Chrome channel, and writes bounded evidence beneath controlled run roots.

The skill controls initial destinations, configured routes and triggers, one direct-request redirect chain, machine identifiers, launch arguments, and evidence paths. It does not claim complete Chromium egress control or DNS-rebinding resistance. Endpoint application control owns system Chrome identity and patch posture, while browser-derived requests, inherited child environments, upstream parsers, and Path A remote redirects remain explicit residual risks.

### Security Posture Overview

| Runtime surface    | Python CLI and configuration guard; Node/Playwright runners; system Chrome; axe CLI; local evidence writers; offline design-intent adapter              |
| Trust buckets      | B1 Path A targets, B2 Path A supply chain, B3 output, B4 caller/filesystem, B5 design intent, B6 Path B navigation, B7 browser, B8 evidence/environment |
| Credentials        | No first-party credential store; child processes inherit the caller environment (G-INF-3)                                                               |
| Network egress     | Authorized Path A HTTP(S), npm on Path A cache miss, Path B HTTP(S) browser/direct requests, and target-derived browser requests                        |

## System Description

### Components

1. `scripts/scan.py` classifies a Path A target, authorizes non-loopback HTTP(S), invokes the pinned axe CLI from the isolated `scripts/scanner_npm` project, normalizes JSON, and writes output.
2. `scripts/runtime_a11y/_config.py` loads Path B JSON configuration, enforces schema and URL semantics, and authorizes the base host.
3. `scripts/runtime_a11y/__main__.py` selects surfaces and probes, then starts Node/npm/PowerShell children with the caller environment.
4. `scripts/runtime_a11y/runner/*.mjs` validates navigation and identifiers, launches Playwright, drives probes, and emits evidence.
5. Playwright 1.61.1 and `@axe-core/playwright` 4.12.1 are installed from the skill-local lockfile.
6. Endpoint-managed system Chrome is selected by Playwright `channel: 'chrome'` with fixed launch arguments and an ephemeral automation profile.
7. Guidepup 0.34.0 starts the manifest-selected NVDA asset, applies isolated settings, synthesizes allowlisted input, binds the foreground Chrome window, captures bounded speech, and verifies cleanup.
8. `_intent.py` and `_projection.py` perform offline design-intent verification and rendering.
9. `runtime_a11y/evidence_bundle/` validates downstream catalogs and evidence, verifies artifact integrity, reconciles privacy-minimized reviewer supplements, and atomically composes non-attestation bundles.

## Bucket B1: Path A remote and local targets

### Spoofing

* The classifier parses HTTP(S) authority before host authorization and rejects credentials. The skill does not authenticate target identity beyond URL and endpoint transport behavior.

### Tampering

* Target text is classified before subprocess execution. Local targets become canonical file URIs; remote targets retain their authorized HTTP(S) form.
* Target content remains untrusted browser input and can influence accessibility results.

### Repudiation

* The normalized result records the resolved target. The skill does not provide durable network-request non-repudiation.

### Information Disclosure

* Loopback HTTP(S) is allowed by default. Non-loopback hosts require a repeated host allowlist value or explicit external confirmation.
* Initial authorization does not bind later DNS answers or constrain every redirect and browser-derived request (G-INF-1).
* Local-file access is intentional operator authority. Existing regular files are not limited to the repository, and the skill avoids claiming confinement that it does not enforce.

### Denial of Service

* Hostile pages and large local files can consume browser CPU or memory. Invocation remains operator-scoped and upstream browser limits apply.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Network shares, non-local file authorities, leading-dash targets, and shell interpretation are rejected. Network-shaped paths are rejected at the filesystem boundary on the resolved path, so a `file:` URI cannot decode into a UNC path and elicit an outbound request before the scan starts. Reads still occur with the invoking user's filesystem permissions.

### Risk Rating

| Threat                                                                            | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk | Status                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Remote target reaches unintended internal service after authorization or redirect | Med        | High   | Med           | Partially Mitigated (G-INF-1) |
| Operator selects a sensitive local regular file                                   | Low        | High   | Low           | Accepted operator capability  |
| Hostile target exhausts local browser resources                                   | Low        | Med    | Low           | Partially Mitigated           |

## Bucket B2: Path A scanner toolchain supply chain

### Spoofing

* The axe CLI package name, version, and canonical public registry are fixed. A scanner-local npm project prevents npm from inheriting project configuration from an adopting repository. Registry compromise or substitution of that exact release remains G-SUP-1.

### Tampering

* `npx --yes --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ @axe-core/cli@4.12.1 -- <target>` runs from the scanner-local npm project and uses an argument list and parser boundary without a shell.
* npx may resolve the pinned package at runtime without a committed integrity lock for this path.

### Repudiation

* npm/npx logs are external to the skill; no package-resolution audit record is generated by Path A.

### Information Disclosure

* The subprocess receives the resolved target and inherited environment. The wrapper adds no credential material.

### Denial of Service

* Missing Node/npx or scanner failure produces a typed nonzero result rather than silent degradation.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Shell injection through the target is mitigated by argument-list invocation and leading-dash rejection. Browser parser exploitation remains G-TAM-1.

### Risk Rating

| Threat                             | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk | Status                        |
|------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Substituted pinned scanner package | Low        | High   | Med           | Partially Mitigated (G-SUP-1) |
| Target argument command injection  | Low        | High   | Low           | Mitigated                     |
| Axe browser parser exploitation    | Low        | High   | Med           | Accepted upstream (G-TAM-1)   |

## Bucket B3: Target-derived output

### Spoofing

* Output does not establish an identity. Target-reported text and metadata are data, not authority.

### Tampering

* Path A requires valid JSON and emits a fixed normalized shape. Path B validates and contains generated artifacts according to each evidence writer's contract.

### Repudiation

* Run metadata, artifact hashes where present, target identifiers, and intent digests support traceability. The skill does not claim cryptographic non-repudiation.

### Information Disclosure

* Target-controlled rule descriptions, URLs, DOM snapshots, screenshots, traces, announcements, and metadata can enter evidence (G-INF-2).
* Traces and screenshots can preserve page content. Operators must avoid targets containing personal or secret data unless the owning workflow permits that evidence.

### Denial of Service

* Normalized Path A results bound propagated structure. Path B limits specific collections and artifact sizes where configured, but browser-generated evidence can still be large.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Evidence is never interpreted as instructions by the runtime. Downstream agents and users must retain the untrusted-content boundary.

### Risk Rating

| Threat                                        | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk | Status                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Target-derived content leaks through evidence | Med        | Med    | Med           | Partially Mitigated (G-INF-2) |
| Malformed scanner output changes control flow | Med        | Low    | Low           | Mitigated                     |
| Oversized browser evidence consumes disk      | Low        | Med    | Low           | Partially Mitigated           |

## Bucket B4: Caller process and filesystem authority

### Spoofing

* The CLIs run as the invoking OS user and do not assert a separate identity.

### Tampering

* Argument parsers, typed configuration, path containment, regular-file checks, and portable identifiers constrain caller-selected values at their owning boundaries.

### Repudiation

* Deterministic exit codes and run metadata identify success, usage failure, and runtime failure, but caller identity is not independently attested.

### Information Disclosure

* The caller can direct output to paths writable by that user. The skill does not elevate permissions or protect data from the invoking user.

### Denial of Service

* The caller controls invocation frequency and target selection. The skill runs no shared network listener.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Output and local-file operations execute with caller privileges. Existing no-follow and containment controls protect runtime-owned paths; arbitrary caller-owned output remains operator authority.

## Bucket B5: Design-intent verification

### Spoofing

* The adapter evaluates local authored input against local results and does not assert external identity.

### Tampering

* Duplicate-key rejection, safe YAML loading, authored schema and semantic validation, boolean-only blocking, identifier validation, and deterministic digest binding protect the verification contract.
* The verifier reads human override outcome only to derive effective gate behavior; it does not rewrite the observed outcome or authored record.

### Repudiation

* Verification output records intent and expectation identities plus a digest of the authored revision. Human override metadata remains in the authored record.

### Information Disclosure

* Verification artifacts echo authored identifiers and selected rationale-adjacent metadata but are not designed to carry credentials.

### Denial of Service

* Malformed structures fail with typed errors before partial verification output is accepted.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Directory handles, no-follow checks, regular-file enforcement, exclusive temporary files, and handle-relative atomic rename mitigate repository-controlled output redirection on supported platforms.

## Bucket B6: Path B configuration and navigation

### Spoofing

* The Python guard requires an absolute credential-free HTTP(S) base URL with a host, then permits loopback, a configured host allowlist, or explicit external authorization. A CLI base-URL override re-enters this guard before `run-all` or `probe` can start browser work.
* The JavaScript runner reasserts the HTTP(S) invariant before browser launch.

### Tampering

* JSON Schema and Python semantic validation reject invalid configuration before child execution. Configured route paths remain relative to the base origin.
* Navigate and visit triggers resolve relative or absolute HTTP(S) against the authorized origin and reject origin changes before permissive action handling.

### Repudiation

* Selected probe, surface, state, target, and result metadata provide run attribution. No remote server identity attestation is claimed.

### Information Disclosure

* External authorization controls the configured initial host, not every browser-derived request. Route and trigger same-origin checks reduce explicit navigation authority but do not create a network firewall.

### Denial of Service

* Invalid targets and identifiers fail before browser work. Authorized pages can still stall or consume resources within probe-specific timeouts and browser behavior.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Protocol-relative, unsupported-scheme, credential-bearing, malformed, and off-origin configured navigation is rejected. Explicit external authorization never overrides scheme or trigger-origin policy.

### Risk Rating

## Bucket B7: Playwright, endpoint-managed Chrome, and NVDA

### Spoofing

* Playwright selects `channel: 'chrome'`; launch-bound preflight records the browser-reported version. Guidepup selects the manifest-owned NVDA asset and records its version and effective settings. Binary signature, installation provenance, and patch posture are owned by endpoint controls (G-SUP-2).
* The one-time Guidepup setup package name, version, and canonical public registry are fixed. Both setup commands run from the isolated `scripts/runtime_a11y` npm project so an adopting repository cannot select their registry.

### Tampering

* Playwright, axe, and Guidepup dependencies are locked in the skill-local package lock. Chrome receives fixed hardening arguments; NVDA receives isolated settings and allowlisted commands; generic caller arguments are not accepted.
* Target content reaches independent Playwright/system-Chrome parser and rendering surfaces (G-TAM-2).

### Repudiation

* Readiness records Chrome, Guidepup, NVDA asset, profile, and foreground-window evidence. It does not attest binary hashes or signatures.

### Information Disclosure

* Browser requests originate from the workstation network position. NVDA speech can contain target-derived text and remains restricted evidence. No complete interception policy constrains redirects, subresources, Service Workers, WebSockets, downloads, DNS changes, peer IPs, or browser-internal connections.
* The broken-link direct-request helper is narrower: it disables automatic redirects, retries with GET when HEAD returns 405 or 501, and follows at most five validated same-origin HTTP(S) hops.

### Denial of Service

* Browser or NVDA launch, foreground binding, and cleanup failures fail readiness. Partial NVDA starts retain cleanup ownership, failed-start retries require proven cleanup, and browser teardown is bounded. Hostile content or endpoint instability can still exhaust, crash, or stall an authorized run.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Playwright creates an ephemeral automation profile and does not receive a caller-controlled user-data directory or generic launch arguments. NVDA commands synthesize OS-level input only after foreground binding, but focus can still change between verification and dispatch (G-EOP-1). Browser sandbox and endpoint policy remain external controls.

### Risk Rating

## Bucket B8: Path B evidence and child environment

### Spoofing

* Probe, route, surface, state, journey, and visual-review machine identifiers use one portable grammar and are validated before path construction. The grammar rejects trailing-dot aliases and Windows reserved device names, including device names followed by an extension.
* Configuration-supplied aliases do not override a schema-validated identifier. The calibration journey identifier is taken from the validated `id` and re-asserted before any path is composed.
* Reviewer and approver claims complete evidence only when stable pseudonymous identifiers and record digests match a current downstream-produced registry snapshot for the declared method scope.

### Tampering

* Runtime-owned evidence uses contained roots, regular-file checks, atomic patterns, and hashes where supported. Invalid identifiers are rejected rather than normalized into collisions.
* Calibration evidence paths are asserted to remain beneath the resolved run root before any directory is created, so a configured identifier cannot steer a write outside that root.
* Visual-review artifact paths carry route, surface, and state as separate validated segments, so distinct routes sharing a surface and state cannot overwrite each other's evidence.
* Evidence composition validates closed schemas, domain-separated digests, artifact bytes, expected/deferred obligation partitions, and prior-bundle continuity before atomic finalization.

### Repudiation

* Evidence records probe, surface, state, timestamps, browser metadata, source and bundle hashes, and reviewer-history continuity where available. It is traceability evidence, not a non-repudiation guarantee.

### Information Disclosure

* Python-spawned Node/npm/PowerShell children inherit the complete caller environment (G-INF-3). The skill does not claim secret filtering.
* Traces, screenshots, transcripts, and measurements can include target content as described in B3.
* Ordinary composed bundles reject raw speech, transcript paths, credential-shaped values, and unrestricted reviewer identity. A downstream registry producer remains responsible for minimizing its snapshot before invocation.

### Denial of Service

* Artifact limits and bounded collections constrain selected outputs. Child tools and browser evidence can still consume local process, disk, and memory resources.
* Large caller catalogs and evidence histories can consume memory during pure composition; downstream workflows own input size and retention policy.

### Elevation of Privilege

* Child commands use argument lists and fixed runner modules. Environment inheritance can alter tool behavior, but no untrusted caller-to-command-string boundary is introduced.

Path A local-file scanning is not folded into G-INF-1. It is an explicit operator-authorized capability to read any selected existing regular local file with the operator's permissions, without repository confinement. A separate local-file disclosure gap is warranted only if a less-trusted caller or confinement requirement becomes supported.
