"""Byte-level fuzz harness for :mod:`pdf_safety`.

Feeds arbitrary byte sequences into the validation boundary to confirm
that the only exception type which ever escapes is
:class:`PdfSafetyError` (or one of its subclasses).

Convention note: existing ``test_fuzz_*.py`` files in this skill use
Hypothesis for byte-level fuzzing; the polyglot Atheris harness lives
in :mod:`tests.fuzz_harness`. This file follows the established
``test_fuzz_*.py`` Hypothesis convention so it runs unconditionally
under pytest on every supported platform (Atheris is manylinux-only and
sits in the optional ``fuzz`` dependency group).
