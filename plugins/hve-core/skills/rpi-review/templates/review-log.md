## Findings and Proposed Routes

Order findings by severity and impact. If none are supported, state that no substantive findings were identified within the assessed boundary and retain any coverage limitations. Do not create a placeholder finding.

<!-- Decisions live here. Append events; never rewrite the evidence body above to fit a decision. -->

### Current Disposition

This summary is derived from Decision History, not a second decision record. The latest event for each subject governs; refresh this summary after appending decisions and on recovery.

### Decision History

Append events in order. Never rewrite or delete an earlier row. The latest event for a subject is current.

### Acceptance and Change Coverage

| Requirement or scope                                   | Implementation and validation evidence                | Assessment                  | Finding or rationale                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| {{requirement_id_Pxx_Pxx_Txx_or_material_plan_update}} | {{paths_headings_symbols_and_supplied_check_results}} | {{Met_Gap_or_Not_assessed}} | {{RV_id_or_supported_reconciliation_reason}} |

Cover every material requirement and in-scope completion claim, grouping rows only when their evidence and assessment are shared. Include implementation-time plan updates and confirmed decisions. Keep detailed gaps in their findings instead of repeating them here.

### Critique and Follow-Up Assessment

* Latest critique dispositions: {{coverage_summary_or_critique_skipped}}
* Material revisions: {{discovery_plan_detail_reconciliation_and_any_follow_up_critique}}
* Dependent-work pause assessment: {{no_early_resumption_or_gap}}
* Justification assessment: {{supported_or_unresolved_rationale}}

| Follow-up item   | Why outside immediate scope | Owner or next action     | Assessment and route                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| {{item_or_none}} | {{reason}}                  | {{owner_or_next_action}} | {{resolved_open_or_distinct_follow_up_route}} |

Unresolved plan follow-up items remain distinct follow-up work. Do not treat them as defects or add them to active `Pxx` or `Pxx-Txx` implementation, completion, or acceptance scope.

### Reviewer Self-Check

* [ ] Every supplied requirement, acceptance criterion, in-scope marker, material update, critique disposition, validation result, blocker, remaining item, and plan follow-up has an assessment or explicit gap.
* [ ] Findings are substantive, evidence-grounded, severity-graded, and use stable `RV-xxx` IDs with expected and observed behavior, a resolution condition, and one proposed route each.
* [ ] Execution status, assessed outcome, validation coverage, limitations, and proposed routes are complete and internally consistent.
* [ ] The summary is scoped and advisory, findings keep their supporting context together, and acceptance coverage distinguishes demonstrated gaps from unassessed behavior.
* [ ] Standard review completely assessed the material boundary while omitting restatement, cosmetic feedback, exhaustive strengths, low-impact suggestions, and continual narration; deep review remained inside the supplied boundary.
* [ ] The review did not mutate source, the plan, critique, research, or changes record, did not execute validation, and verified any helper candidate at its cited evidence before recording it as a finding.
* Checked boundary: {{requirements_markers_updates_validation_follow_ups_and_gaps}}
* Missing or limited evidence: {{none_or_exact_unassessed_boundary}}
