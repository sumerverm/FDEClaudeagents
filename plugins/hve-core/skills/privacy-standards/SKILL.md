## Privacy Standards Skill

This skill is the reusable privacy reference package for the Privacy Planner and Privacy Reviewer. It consolidates the privacy standards backbone, the core data-flow and classification heuristics, and the DPIA threshold logic needed to keep privacy reviews focused on workflow, evidence, and implementation readiness.

> [!NOTE]
> This skill is a planning aid, not legal advice. Its standards summaries support privacy reasoning and review preparation; they do not substitute for qualified legal counsel or a formal regulatory interpretation.

## Attribution and licensing posture

- NIST Privacy Framework and NISTIR 8062 are U.S. Government documents and are referenced here with attribution as public-domain reference material. Public-domain material carries no license obligation, so it adds no term to the package license expression.
- GDPR and CCPA/CPRA content is paraphrased and attributed rather than quoted verbatim, consistent with the repository's open legal-text posture. The paraphrase is this repository's own expression.
- OWASP privacy-risk material is adapted from the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks project, which is licensed CC BY-SA 3.0. ShareAlike propagates to that derivative, so it is the one file carrying a copyleft term.

The frontmatter expression is the conjunction of every license present in the package. The table states which license governs each file.

## Privacy planning heuristics

- Start with a data inventory and map the personal data lifecycle: collection, transfer, storage, use, sharing, retention, and deletion.
- Separate the data categories from the processing purpose so the planner or reviewer can assess necessity, proportionality, and appropriate control selection.
- Identify whether the workflow involves sensitive data, automated decision-making, profiling, or cross-organization sharing, because these conditions often trigger a deeper review.
- Track the evidence trail for each privacy decision so the handoff can include the standards references, the supporting rationale, and the review context.

## Citation-field vocabulary

Use these fields when capturing a finding, control, or risk so the reviewer can assert a stable source-control reference:

- `gdpr_article`
- `ccpa_section`
- `nist_pf_category`
- `nistir8062_objective`
- `owasp_privacy_id`

## Phase-to-framework mapping

| Privacy phase         | Primary standards package                    | Notes                                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 Capture       | NIST Privacy Framework + GDPR                | Context, scope, and legal basis framing              |
| Phase 2 Data Mapping  | NIST Privacy Framework + NISTIR 8062         | Data inventory, purpose, and minimization reasoning  |
| Phase 3 Risk and DPIA | GDPR + CCPA/CPRA + NISTIR 8062               | DPIA triggers, risk analysis, and proportionality    |
| Phase 4 Controls      | NIST Privacy Framework + OWASP Privacy Risks | Controls for collection, use, sharing, and retention |
| Phase 5 Impact        | GDPR + CCPA/CPRA + OWASP Privacy Risks       | Potential harm, mitigation, and monitoring           |
| Phase 6 Handoff       | All sources                                  | Evidence handoff, review notes, and action tracking  |
