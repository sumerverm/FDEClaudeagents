> **Role.** Before doing anything else, load the `hve-core:security-reviewer` skill with the `Skill` tool and operate under it for the rest of this task.

> **Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`
>
> Parse the arguments above (typically `key=value` form, see the argument hint) into: `{{mode}}`, `{{plan}}`, `{{scope}}`, `{{targetSkill}}`. A missing optional value means its documented default.


# Vulnerability Scan

> [!CAUTION]
> This prompt is an **assistive tool only** and does not replace professional security tooling (SAST, DAST, SCA, penetration testing, compliance scanners) or qualified human review. All AI-generated vulnerability findings **must** be reviewed and validated by qualified security professionals before use. AI outputs may contain inaccuracies, miss critical threats, or produce recommendations that are incomplete or inappropriate for your environment.

## Inputs

* {{mode}}: (Optional, defaults to audit) Scanning mode: `audit`, `diff`, or `plan`.
* {{targetSkill}}: (Optional) Single skill to assess. Bypasses codebase profiling when provided. Available skills: `owasp-agentic`, `owasp-llm`, `owasp-top-10`, `owasp-mcp`, `owasp-infrastructure`, `owasp-cicd`, `secure-by-design`.
* {{scope}}: (Optional) Specific directories or paths to focus on. When omitted, assesses the full codebase.
* {{plan}}: (Optional) Implementation plan document path. Inferred from attached files or conversation context when not provided.

## Requirements

1. Route `{{mode}}` to the agent's corresponding mode. When omitted, default to `audit`.
2. When `{{scope}}` is provided, limit analysis to files within the specified directories or paths.
3. When `{{targetSkill}}` is provided, bypass codebase profiling and assess only the specified skill.
4. When `{{plan}}` is provided and mode is `plan`, pass the document path to the agent for plan-mode analysis.
