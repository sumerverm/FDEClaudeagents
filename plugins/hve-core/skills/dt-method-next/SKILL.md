# DT Method Next

## Inputs

* ${input:project-slug}: (Optional) Project slug identifying the DT project directory. If omitted, inferred from open files under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` or from conversation context.

## Requirements

* All DT coaching artifacts are scoped to `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/`. Never write DT artifacts directly under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` without a project-slug directory.

### 1. Locate Project Directory

**Goal:** Find the coaching state file for the specified or inferred project.

* Derive project-slug from input, open files, or conversation context
* Look for coaching state at `.copilot-tracking/dt/{project-slug}/coaching-state.md`
* If not found and multiple projects exist, list available projects with last session dates and ask user to select
* **Edge case — No project found:** If no DT project exists, respond: "No Design Thinking project found. Start a new project by running `/hve-core:dt-start-project` and describing what you would like to work on."

### 2. Read and Assess Current State

**Goal:** Extract current method, space, completion status, and progress indicators.

* Read the coaching state YAML frontmatter:
  * `current.method` (1-9): active method number
  * `current.space` (problem|solution|implementation): derived from method number
  * `current.phase`: free-text step within current method
  * `methods_completed`: array of completed method numbers
  * `transition_log`: history of method changes with rationales
  * `session_log`: recent session summaries
  * `artifacts`: list of generated artifacts with paths
* Scan the project directory for artifact subdirectories matching `method-{NN}-*/` patterns
* Load `dt-coaching-foundation` and assess method completeness by comparing artifacts against exit signals from its `references/method-sequencing.md`

### 3. Determine Next Method Recommendation

**Goal:** Suggest appropriate next method based on state analysis and sequencing rules.

Apply progression logic:

* **Forward progression (primary path):**
  * If current method has artifacts and exit signals met → suggest method + 1
  * At space boundaries (3→4, 6→7): verify readiness signals before suggesting transition

* **Backward iteration (secondary path):**
  * Before recommending a backward transition, read the loaded `dt-coaching-foundation` skill's `references/method-sequencing.md` and quote the matching return-path rule in the recommendation.
  * If current method reveals gaps in prior work → suggest returning to earlier method with rationale
  * Common patterns: prototype issues → Method 2/3, brainstorming failure → Method 3, concept misalignment → Method 1
  * Always name the source method, target method, and the sequencing rule that authorizes the transition.

* **Lateral transitions:**
  * If all 9 methods complete → suggest iteration on Method 9 or handoff to RPI workflow
  * If user requests skipping methods → explain sequencing rationale and offer to proceed with caution

* **Edge case — All complete:** If `methods_completed` includes 1-9, respond: "All 9 Design Thinking methods are complete. You can iterate on Method 9 for optimization, or hand off to RPI workflow for implementation planning. What would you like to focus on?"

* **Edge case — Iteration loop detected:** If the same method or method pair appears 3+ times in the last 6 `transition_log` entries, acknowledge the iteration explicitly: "I notice you've returned to Method [N] multiple times. This suggests [observation about missing foundation]. Would you like to revisit the underlying challenge or continue refining Method [N]?"

### 4. Output Format and Recommendation

**Goal:** Present project status summary with clear next steps.

Provide a concise summary including:

* **Project:** Display name and slug
* **Current Method:** Number, name, and phase description
* **Progress:** Count of completed methods out of 9
* **Recent Work:** Summary from last session log entry
* **Key Artifacts:** Highlight 2-3 critical artifacts from current method directory

Then present recommendation:

* **Suggested Next Method:** Number and name with rationale tied to exit signals or discovered gaps
* **Transition Type:** Forward progression, backward iteration, or lateral handoff
* **Readiness Check:** For space boundary transitions, validate these signals:
  * 3→4 (Problem→Solution): Themes validated across sources, team alignment confirmed, HMW questions formulated
  * 6→7 (Solution→Implementation): Lo-fi prototypes tested with real users, core assumptions validated, concepts narrowed to 1-2 directions
* **User Choice:** "Does this direction make sense, or would you prefer to target a different method?"
* **Figma Export:** At space boundaries (3→4, 6→7) or after methods that produce visual artifacts (M1, M3, M4, M5, M6), mention: "You can also export these artifacts to a FigJam board for team review using `/hve-core:dt-figma-export`."

### 5. Delegate to DT Coach

After presenting the recommendation, wait for user confirmation of the suggested method or their choice of a different method. Once confirmed, transition coaching into the target method by:

* Updating `coaching-state.md` with new `current.method` value
* Adding transition log entry with rationale and date
* Loading the target method skill for method-specific knowledge
* Beginning active coaching at the appropriate phase within the target method

Assess the Design Thinking project state and recommend the next method to pursue based on completion indicators and sequencing rules.
